.. sectionauthor:: Bernhard Posselt <dev@bernhard-posselt.com>

After :doc:`you've set up the development environment and installed the dev tool <../general/devenv>` change into the Nextcloud apps directory::

    cd /var/www/owncloud/apps

Then run::

    ocdev startapp MyApp --email mail@example.com --author "Your Name" --description "My first app" --owncloud 8

This will create all the needed files in the current directory. For more information on how to customize the generated app, see the `Project's GitHub page <https://github.com/owncloud/ocdev>`_ or run::

    ocdev startapp -h

Enable the app
--------------
The app can now be enabled on the Nextcloud apps page

* **css/**: Contains the CSS
* **js/**: Contains the JavaScript files
* **lib/Controller/**: Contains the controllers
* **lib/**: Contains the other class files of your app
