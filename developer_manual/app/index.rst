Intro
-----

Before you start, please check if there already is a similar app in the `App Store <https://apps.nextcloud.com>`_ or the `GitHub organisation <https://github.com/nextcloud/>`_ that you could contribute to. Also, feel free to communicate your idea and plans in the `forum <https://help.nextcloud.com/>`_ so other contributors might join in.

Then, please make sure you have set up a development environment:

* :doc:`../general/devenv`

Before starting to write an app please read the security and coding guidelines:

* :doc:`../general/security`
* :doc:`../general/codingguidelines`

After this you can start with the tutorial

* :doc:`tutorial`

Once you are ready for publishing, check out the app store process:

* :doc:`publishing`

For enhanced security it is also possible to sign your code:

* :doc:`code_signing`

App development
---------------

Take a look at the changes in this version:

* :doc:`changelog`

Create a new app:

* :doc:`startapp`

Inner parts of an app:

* :doc:`init`
* :doc:`info`
* :doc:`classloader`

Requests
^^^^^^^^

How a request is being processed:

* :doc:`request`
* :doc:`routes`
* :doc:`middleware`

^^^^

The app's presentation layer:

* :doc:`templates`
* :doc:`js`
* :doc:`css`
* :doc:`l10n`
* :doc:`theming`

Storage
^^^^^^^

Create database tables, run Sql queries, store/retrieve configuration information and access the filesystem:

* :doc:`logging`

Migrations
^^^^^^^^^^

Migrations can be used to do database changes which are allowing apps a more granular updating mechanism:

* :doc:`migrations`

Repair steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Repair steps can be used to run code at various stages in app installation, uninstallation, migration and more:

* :doc:`repair`

Testing
^^^^^^^

Write automated tests to ensure stability and ease maintenance:

* :doc:`testing`

PHPDoc class documentation
