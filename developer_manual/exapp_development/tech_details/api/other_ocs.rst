Other OCS APIs
==============

With AppAPI authentication, it is possible for ExApps to use any other OCS APIs that don't require OCP implementation:

.. note::

	To access these APIs, they have to be supported by AppAPI,
	and the ExApp must grant access to them (in ``info.xml``) accordingly.

1. Calendar
2. Contacts
3. File System & Tags
4. Shares
5. Notifications
6. Users & Groups
7. User & Weather status
8. Activities
9. Notes
10. Etc.
