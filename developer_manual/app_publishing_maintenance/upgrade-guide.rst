App upgrade guide
=================

Once you've created and published the first version of your app, you will want to keep it up to date with the latest Nextcloud features.

This document will cover the most important changes in Nextcloud, as well as some guides on how to upgrade existing apps.

Changed APIs
************

* ``\OCP\User\Events\UserLoggedInEvent::getPassword`` is now nullable because logins are possible without a password in SSO setups

Deprecated APIs
***************

* ``\OCP\Calendar\IManager::search``: use :ref:`the new calendar search API<calendar-search>`
* ``\OCP\Calendar\IManager::isEnabled``: there is no replacement
* ``\OCP\Calendar\IManager::registerCalendar``: use :ref:`calendar providers<calendar-providers>`
* ``\OCP\Calendar\IManager::unregisterCalendar`` there is no replacement

General
^^^^^^^

Migration commands
******************

The occ commands in the ``migration:*`` namespace are now only available in :ref:`debug mode<debug-mode>`.

See `the pull request on GitHub <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/27113>`__ for more information. If you thought you needed them, feel free to ping the author or a reviewer of the PR to solve the problem correctly. Running migrations directly mostly breaks the database status and is therefore only meant for debugging faulty migrations.

Log format
**********

The JSON log format no longer contains full exception in the message field, but a separate exception entry is added and the existing message will only contain the exception message text. This might need adjustments by administrators when logs are extracted to external sources.

Front-end changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scss variable and compilation deprecation
*****************************************

Nextcloud is slowly phasing out scss variables and the compilation of app style sheets. It's recommended that apps use their own compilation (e.g. through Webpack) to transform scss and similar to plain css. The ability of Nextcloud compiling scss for apps will be removed in the future. Subscribe to `GitHub ticket 9940 <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/9940>`__ to get updates on how to best approach this. Right now some scss variables can be replaced with css variables. Other mechanisms like the icon generation still depend on the scss compilation by Nextcloud.

Node.js upgrade
***************

Most Nextcloud apps and Nextcloud itself is now built with Node v14 LTS instead of v12. We recommend updating the configuration of your app accordingly.

IE11 removal
************

Internet Explorer 11 was phased out over the past few releases and starting with Nextcloud 22 the front-end code isn't transpiled for IE11 any longer. You may also drop IE11 from your app as core components will possibly fail with this browser anyway.

Deprecated global variables
***************************

* ``DOMPurify``: ship your own.

Back-end changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removed support for database.xml
********************************

The support for an app's ``appinfo/database.xml`` has been removed.

PSR events
**********

In order to bring Nextcloud APIs closer to :ref:`psr` the base event class no longer extends the old Symfony event class but only ``\Psr\EventDispatcher\StoppableEventInterface``. From an app's perspective this change is transparent.

PSR container
*************

The :ref:`PSR 11 container interface <psr11>` was updated from version 1.0 to 1.1.

LDAP factory availability
*************************

``\OCP\LDAP\ILDAPProviderFactory`` received a new method ``isAvailable`` so apps can check if LDAP is configured and used before any attributes are fetched or similar.

Boolean database columns
************************

Since Oracle can not store booleans in a non-nullable boolean column Nextcloud doesn't support non-null boolean columns anymore. Apps have to migrate their schema to nullable boolean columns.


HTTP 401 for invalid username/password
**************************************

When invalid username/password is sent to a Nextcloud API, Nextcloud will now respond with a HTTP 401 status instead of 403.


Removed APIs
************

* ``\OC\Memcache\Factory::create``
* ``\OCP\User``
* ``\OCP\Util::isIe``

Deprecated APIs
***************

* ``\OCP\Log\ILogFactory::getCustomLogger``: use ``\OCP\Log\ILogFactory::getCustomPsrLogger`` to get a customized :ref:`PSR3 <psr3>` logger
* Event ``\OCP\IDBConnection::ADD_MISSING_INDEXES`` and the corresponding constant ``\OCP\IDBConnection::ADD_MISSING_INDEXES_EVENT``: internal event
* Event ``\OCP\IDBConnection::CHECK_MISSING_INDEXES`` and the corresponding constant ``\OCP\IDBConnection::CHECK_MISSING_INDEXES_EVENT``: internal event
* Event ``\OCP\IDBConnection::ADD_MISSING_PRIMARY_KEYS`` and the corresponding constant ``\OCP\IDBConnection::ADD_MISSING_PRIMARY_KEYS_EVENT``: internal event
* Event ``\OCP\IDBConnection::CHECK_MISSING_PRIMARY_KEYS`` and the corresponding constant ``\OCP\IDBConnection::CHECK_MISSING_PRIMARY_KEYS_EVENT``: internal event
* Event ``\OCP\IDBConnection::ADD_MISSING_COLUMNS_EVENT`` and the corresponding constant ``\OCP\IDBConnection::ADD_MISSING_COLUMNS``: internal event
* Event ``\OCP\IDBConnection::CHECK_MISSING_COLUMNS`` and the corresponding constant ``\OCP\IDBConnection::CHECK_MISSING_COLUMNS``: internal event

Upgrading to Nextcloud 21
-------------------------

.. note:: Critical changes were collected `on GitHub <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/23210>`__. See the original ticket for links to the pull requests and tickets.

General
^^^^^^^

The biggest change in Nextcloud 21 is the initial support for PHP 8 and the corresponding updates of many core dependencies, which could have direct and indirect consequences for apps.

PHP 8 support
*************

Nextcloud 21 is the first major release that is compatible with the new PHP 8.0. As a consequence, some previously working syntax can cause problems when an app is deployed with PHP newer than 7.4. The full changelog can be found `on the php.net website <https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php>`__. There is also a document for all breaking changes `on GitHub <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0/UPGRADING#L20>`__.

To check compatibility automatically we recommend adding or updating the :ref:`app-ci` of your app so that linters, tests and static analysis can warn you about any problems before the app is shipped to users.

Updated core libraries
**********************

If apps use only official public APIs of Nextcloud, the update of core libraries should have little to no effect on apps. However, there are some edge cases where an app still has a code dependency to a library shipped with Nextcloud, e.g. when those 3rdparty classes or functions are used, and therefore app developers are recommended to check their code for any incompatibility. Moreover it's recommended to check compatibility with sophisticated tools, as documented at the  :ref:`static analysis<app-static-analysis>` section.

``doctrine/dbal``
=================

The Doctrine Database Abstraction Layer powers Nextcloud's database connection and query builder. In Nextcloud 21, this dependency was updated from 2.x to 3.0. As a consequence, some types that were previously exported through the Nextcloud OCP API are removed or changed by this update. For backwards-compatibility, there is now a tiny compatibility layer between the original Doctrine API and what apps use via the Nextcloud API.

Optimistically speaking, the database connection and the query builder should mostly work like in Nextcloud 20 or older. The main differences are that prepared statements and query results are not handled by the removed Doctrine ``Statement`` but two new Nextcloud types ``IPreparedStatement`` and ``IResult``. You don't have to worry about these types unless you pass around the result of a query to class/method/function with type hints. In this rare case, please adjust the type hints accordingly for the new type if you only support Nextcloud 21 in your apps or remove the type hint temporarily for multi-version Nextcloud support.

Some (minor) breaking changes were inevitable. Here's the summary

* Many of the database connection methods have now a documented exception that can be thrown: ``\OCP\DB\Exception``. This also acts as a replacement for the removed ``\Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException``.
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->fetch()`` only has one argument now (there were three previously)
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->fetchColumn()`` has no more arguments and got also deprecated. Use ``fetchOne`` instead
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->bindParam()`` was removed because conceptually it does not make sense to bind a parameter *after* executing a query. Use ``bindParam`` on the ``IPeparedStatement`` instead.
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->bindValue()`` was removed because conceptually it does not make sense to bind a value *after* executing a query. Use ``bindValue`` on the ``IPeparedStatement`` instead.
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->columnCount()`` was removed
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->errorCode()`` was removed from Doctrine
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->errorInfo()`` was removed from Doctrine
* ``$queryBuilder->execute()->setFetchMode()`` was removed from Doctrine
* ``$connection->prepare()->execute()`` previously returned ``false`` under some error conditions, it now always gives you an ``IResult`` or throws a ``\OCP\DB\Exception``.
* ``\Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type::*`` type constants were moved, which some apps used for column type constants in apps. Use the new ``\OCP\DB\Types::*`` as a replacement.

The details of this change can also be seen in the `pull request on GitHub <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/24948>`__ and in the upstream `dbal 3.0.xx upgrade document <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/3.0.x/UPGRADE.md>`__.

``guzzlehttp/guzzle``
=====================

The HTTP client library behind the Nextcloud HTTP client was updated for PHP 8 compatibility. The Nextcloud abstraction remained untouched and will work like before. If you used Guzzle directly, make sure you don't use the fluent API on requests or responses.

``psr/log``
===========

The :ref:`psr3` package was updated to v1.1. The ``log`` method can now theoretically throw an ``\Psr\Log\InvalidArgumentException``, though Nextcloud does not make use of this at the moment. It's recommended to check any usage of the method nevertheless and add error handling if appropriate.

``sabre/*``
===========

The Sabre packages received a minor update. Only apps that provide DAV functionality should be effected, if any.

App code checker deprecation
****************************

The app code checker (``occ app:check-code myapp``) is obsolete due to :ref:`static analysis<app-static-analysis>`. For Nextcloud 21 it will act as NOOP, meaning that you can still call the command but it will never fail. This allows you to still use it on CI if you test against 21, 20 and older releases. But prepare the switch to static analysis if you haven't already. Please also note that the app code checker hadn't received many updates recently, hence the number of issues it can detect is low.

PSR-0 deprecation
*****************

The original `PSR-0` standard was deprecated in 2014 and therefore the support for it in Nextcloud will also end soon. Hence we recommend migrating your class file names to `PSR-4`.

.. _`PSR-0`: https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/
.. _`PSR-4`: https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/

Last version with database.xml support and migration
****************************************************

Nextcloud 21 is the last major release that supports an app's ``appinfo/database.xml`` to define the database schema. This is your last chance to automatically convert this deprecated file into the new migration classes using ``occ migrations:generate-from-schema``.

Replaced well-known handler API
*******************************

There was an old, unused and inofficial mechanism to hook into well-known discovery via config settings. This includes ``host-meta``, ``host-meta.json``, ``nodeinfo`` and ``webfinger``. A :ref:`new public API replaces this mechanism<web-host-metadata>` in Nextcloud 21.

Upgrading to Nextcloud 20
-------------------------

.. note:: Critical changes were collected `on GitHub <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/20953>`__. See the original ticket for links to the pull requests and tickets.

Front-end changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Body theme
**********

The body theme classes are now ``theme--highcontrast``, ``theme--dark`` and/or ``theme--light``.

jQuery update
*************

jQuery was updated to v2.2. The most notable change is that ``$(document).ready(...)`` or ``$(...)`` for short fires sooner than before. Use the `DOMContentLoaded event <https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded>`_ instead.

Search
******

The :ref:`unified search<unified-search>` replaces the traditional search input, hence ``OCA.Search`` became a noop. For backwards compatibility, the code will not raise any errors now, but it does not have any functionality.

Removed globals
***************

* ``escape-html``: use `the escape-html package <https://www.npmjs.com/package/escape-html>` or similar

Deprecated global variables
***************************

* ``humanFileSize``: use ``formatfilesize`` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nextcloud/files
* ``OC.getCanonicalLocale``: use ``getCanonicalLocale`` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nextcloud/l10n

Removed jQuery plugins
**********************

* ``$.tipsy``

Back-end changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

App bootstrap logic
*******************

The code that initializes an app or anything that should run for every request and command is now moved to a dedicated and typed API. The ``appinfo/app.php`` is therefore obsolete and deprecated. See :ref:`bootstrapping<Bootstrapping>` for details.

.. _upgrade-psr3:

PSR-3 integration
*****************

Nextcloud 20 is the first major release of Nextcloud that brings full compatibility with :ref:`psr3`. From this point on it is highly recommended to use this interface mainly as the old ``\OCP\ILogger`` got deprecated with the last remaining changes. The majority of methods are identical between the Nextcloud-specific interface and the PSR one. Pay attention to usages of ``\OCP\ILogger::logException`` as that method does not exist on the PSR logger. However, you can specifcy an ``exception`` key in the ``$context`` argument of any ``\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`` method and Nextcloud will format it like it did with the old ``logException``.

.. _upgrade-psr11:

PSR-11 integration
******************

Nextcloud 20 is the first major release of Nextcloud that brings full compatibility with :ref:`psr11`. From this point on it is highly recommended to use this interface mainly as the old ``\OCP\IContainer`` got deprecated with this change.

The interfaces ``\OCP\AppFramework\IAppContainer`` and ``\OCP\IServerContainer`` will remain, but they won't extend the ``IContainer`` anymore once that interface gets removed. As a result, ``IAppContainer`` and ``IServerContainer`` will eventually become tagging interfaces with the sole purpose of making it possible to have either the app or server container injected explicitly.

If your app requires Nextcloud 20 or later, you can replace any of the old type hints with one of ``\Psr\Container\ContainerInterface`` and replace calls of ``query`` with ``get``, e.g. on the closures used when registering services:

.. code-block:: php

  // old
  $container->registerService('DecryptAll', function (IAppContainer $c) {
    return new DecryptAll(
      $c->query('Util'),
      $c->query(KeyManager::class),
      $c->query('Crypt'),
      $c->query(ISession::class)
    )
  })

becomes

.. code-block:: php

  // new
  $container->registerService('DecryptAll', function (ContainerInterface $c) {
    return new DecryptAll(
      $c->get('Util'),
      $c->get(KeyManager::class'),
      $c->get('Crypt'),
      $c->get(ISession::class)
    )
  })

.. note:: For a smoother transition, the old interfaces were changed so they are based on ``ContainerInterface``, hence you can use ``has`` and ``get`` on ``IContainer`` and sub types.

Upgrading to Nextcloud 19
-------------------------

.. note:: Critical changes were collected `on GitHub <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/18479>`__. See the original ticket for links to the pull requests and tickets.

Front-end changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

jQuery deprecation
******************

As of Nextcloud 19, the global `jquery` and `$` are deprecated for apps. While the library won't be removed immediately to give developers time to adapt, we encourage you to either replace it with another library or simply use a bundling tool like webpack to scope it to your own. The library will be upgraded in Nextcloud in future versions of Nextcloud and there are breaking changes in the newer versions of jQuery.

Back-end changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Symfony update
**************

Symfony was updated to `v4.4 <https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/CHANGELOG-4.4.md>`__. The most important change for apps is to return an int value from CLI commands. Returning null (explicitly or implicitly) won't be allowed in future versions of Symfony.

Deprecation of injection of named services
******************************************

Apps had been able to query core services like the implementation of the interface ``\OCP\ITagManager`` as ``TagManager``. To unify the service resolution with type hints for the constructor injection, the named resolution is deprecated, logs warnings and will be removed in the future. Use the fully-qualifier class name (with the `::class` constant) instead:

If you had

.. code-block:: php

  $tagManager = \OC::$server->query('TagManager');

change your code to

.. code-block:: php

  $tagManager = \OC::$server->query(\OCP\ITagManager::class);

On constructor arguments you should always type-hint the service by its interface. If you do so already, nothing changes for you.
