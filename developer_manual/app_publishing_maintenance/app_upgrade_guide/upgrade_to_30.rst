=======================
Upgrade to Nextcloud 30
=======================

General
-------

A new dependency type ``backend`` was added to info.xml.
If your app requires or makes use of the CalDAV backend in server, please add the backend
``caldav`` to the dependencies of your app.

.. code-block:: xml

   <dependencies>
       <backend>caldav</backend>
   </dependencies>

If no app is requiring the CalDAV backend, the CalDAV section in the admin settings will be hidden.
Currently, there is no other effect but that might change in the future.

Capabilities
------------

``files``
^^^^^^^^^

- ``blacklist_files_regex`` is deprecated now use ``forbidden_filenames`` instead
- ``forbidden_filename_characters`` was added to provide a list of characters not allowed within filenames
- ``forbidden_filename_extensions`` was added to provide a list of extensions (suffixes) not allowed for filenames

Front-end changes
-----------------

Clickable area
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The size of the CSS variable ``--clickable-area`` variable has shrunk from ``44px`` to ``34px``. 
This will result in several regressions and paper-cuts in your app that will need to be manually fixed.
It's recommended to:

1) Link the ``@nextcloud/vue`` current master to your app (pull often cause fixes are getting in there too);
2) Do a codebase-wide search of `44px` and replace with the variable `--default-clickable-area` if appropriate;
3) Check for regressions and visual bugs;
4) Report the regression of your app in this issue (you can create a heading with the name of your own app);
5) Also report ``@nextlcoud/vue`` library regressions if they're not reported already in their list;
6) Fix regression in your app (only the ones that are unrelated to the ``@nextcloud/vue`` components);

Line height
^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``--default-line-height`` variable has changed from ``24px``` to ``1.5`` for the ``--default-font-size`` this 
means that the actual value in pixel will go from 24 to 22.5. Although this is a slight change, it's recommended 
to check for visual regressions in your app.


Font sizes
^^^^^^^^^^

Nextcloud now provides meaningful default styles for heading elements.
This can cause visual regressions if your code does not explicitly set font size and weight.
If you need to use heading elements outside of text content, you might need to adjust their styles.

Border radius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The border radius CSS variables have been refactored:

- Added

  - ``--border-radius-small`` was added for smaller elements like chips.
  - ``--border-radius-container`` was added for smaller containers like action menus.
  - ``--border-radius-container-large`` was added for larger containers like body or modals.
  - ``--border-radius-element`` was added for interactive elements such as buttons, input, navigation and list items.

- Deprecated

  - ``--border-radius`` is deprecated now in favor of ``--border-radius-small``.
  - ``--border-radius-large`` is deprecated now in favor of ``--border-radius-element``.
  - ``--border-radius-pill`` is deprecated now in favor of ``--border-radius-element``.
  - ``--border-radius-rounded`` is deprecated now in favor of ``--border-radius-container``.

CSP Nonce
^^^^^^^^^

A bug was fixed that prevented Nextcloud form using the ``CSP_NONCE`` environment variable,
this now means that the CSP nonce for JavaScript assets is no longer (guaranteed to be) based on the CSRF token.
Instead administrators can choose to use a differently generated token.
When using JavaScript modules this does not make a difference, as they are imported and the nonce has only to be set on the root module (done by Nextcloud),
but if you are using Webpack or otherwise dynamically load scripts, you now need adjust the CSP nonce handling.

Get the CSP nonce:

- Either use ``getCSPNonce`` from the ``@nextcloud/auth`` :ref:`package<js-library_nextcloud-auth>`, which is also backwards compatible.
- Or directly read the nonce from the ``<meta name="csp-nonce" />`` tag.

When using Webpack:

.. code-block:: diff

    - import { getRequestToken } from '@nextcloud/auth'
    - __webpack_nonce__ = btoa(getRequestToken())
    + import { getCSPNonce } from '@nextcloud/auth'
    + __webpack_nonce__ = getCSPNonce()

Deprecated APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``OC.config.blacklist_files_regex`` is deprecated now, use the ``files`` capabilities instead
- ``OC.config.forbidden_filename_characters`` is deprecated now, use the ``files`` capabilities instead
- ``OC.dialogs.fileexists`` was already deprecated in Nextcloud 29, but is now also marked as such.
  Use ``openConflictPicker`` from `@nextcloud/upload <https://nextcloud-libraries.github.io/nextcloud-upload/functions/openConflictPicker.html>`_ instead.
- Most ``OC.dialogs`` API is now deprecated and will be removed in the future. For generic dialogs use the ``DialogBuilder`` from the :ref:`js-library_nextcloud-dialogs`.
  A list of the now deprecated methods:

  - ``OC.dialogs.alert``
  - ``OC.dialogs.info``

Back-end changes
----------------

Support for PHP 8.0 removed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this release support for PHP 8.0 was removed. Follow the steps below to make your app compatible.

1. If ``appinfo/info.xml`` has a dependency specification for PHP, increase the ``min-version`` to 8.1.

.. code-block:: xml

  <dependencies>
    <php min-version="8.1" max-version="8.3" />
    <nextcloud min-version="27" max-version="30" />
  </dependencies>


2. If your app has a ``composer.json`` and the file contains the PHP restrictions from ``info.xml``, adjust it as well.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "require": {
      "php": ">=8.1 <=8.3"
    }
  }

3. If you have :ref:`continuous integration <app-ci>` set up, remove PHP 8.0 from the matrices of tests and linters.

Changed APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``OCP\Activity\IEvent::set*()`` (all setters) throw ``OCP\Activity\Exceptions\InvalidValueException`` instead of ``\InvalidArgumentException`` when the value does not match the required criteria.
- Calling ``OCP\Activity\IEvent::setIcon()`` with a relative URL is deprecated and will throw ``OCP\Activity\Exceptions\InvalidValueException`` in a future version.

- ``OCP\Activity\IProvider::parse()`` should no longer throw ``\InvalidArgumentException``. ``OCP\Activity\Exceptions\UnknownNotificationException`` should be thrown when the provider does not want to handle the event. ``\InvalidArgumentException`` are logged as debug for now and will be logged as error in the future to help developers find issues from code that unintentionally threw ``\InvalidArgumentException``
- ``OCP\Dashboard\IIconWidget::getIconUrl()`` clarification: The URL must be an absolute URL. The served icon should be dark. The icon will be inverted automatically in mobile clients and when using dark mode.
- ``OCP\Dashboard\IWidget::getId()`` clarification: Implementations should only return ``a-z``, ``0-9``, ``-`` and ``_`` based strings starting with a letter, as the identifier is used in CSS classes and that is otherwise invalid

Therefore, it is NOT recommended to use a css class that sets the background with ``var(--icon-…)``` as those will adapt to dark/bright mode in the web and still be inverted resulting in a dark icon on dark background.
- ``OCP\Files\Lock\ILockManager::registerLazyLockProvider()`` was added to replace ``registerLockProvider`` and allows to register a lock provider that is only loaded when needed.
- ``OCP\Notification\IAction::set*()`` (all setters) throw ``OCP\Notification\InvalidValueException`` instead of ``\InvalidArgumentException`` when the value does not match the required criteria.
