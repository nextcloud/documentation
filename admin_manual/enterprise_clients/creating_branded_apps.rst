Building a Branded Desktop Sync Client
--------------------------------------

See `Building Branded Nextcloud Clients (Enterprise Only)`_ for instructions on 
building your own branded desktop sync client, and for setting up an automatic 
update service.

Your users may run both a branded and un-branded desktop sync client 
side-by-side. Both clients run independently of each other, and do not share 
account information or files.

Building a Branded iOS App
--------------------------

Building and distributing your branded iOS Nextcloud app involves a large number 
of interdependent steps. The process is detailed in the `Building Branded 
Nextcloud Clients (Enterprise Only)`_ manual. Follow these instructions exactly 
and in order, and you will have a nice branded iOS app that you can distribute 
to your users.

Building an Android App
-----------------------
   
Building and distributing your branded Android Nextcloud app is fairly simple, 
and the process is detailed in 
`Building Branded Nextcloud Clients (Enterprise Only)`_.
