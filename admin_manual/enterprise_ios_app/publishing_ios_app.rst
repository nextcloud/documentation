Building and Distributing Your Branded iOS App
==============================================

Building and distributing your branded iOS ownCloud app involves a large number 
of interdependent steps. The process is detailed in this chapter over several 
pages. Follow these instructions exactly and in order, and you will have a nice 
branded iOS app that you can distribute to your users.

Prerequisites
=============

* A Mac OS X computer with Xcode (free download) and Keychain Access 
  (included in Utilities)
* An iOS developer account on 
  `Developer.Apple.com/ios <https://developer.apple.com/ios/>`_, 
  which costs $99 per year.
* An ownCloud Enterprise Subscription, with the ownBrander app enabled on 
  `Customer.owncloud.com <https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud>`_
* Some iPhones or iPads for testing your app, which must have their UDIDs 
  registered in your account on `Developer.Apple.com 
  <https://developer.apple.com>`_. You may register up to 100 devices.

Procedure
=========
  
You need the Apple tools to build three provisioning profiles and a P12 
certificate, which you will email to branding@owncloud.com after building your 
app with the ownBrander app on `Customer.owncloud.com 
<https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud>`_. It is best to create the 
provisioning profiles and P12 certificate first, before building your app, 
because you must supply a unique **bundle ID** and an **app group** to build 
your app. These are created in your account on `Developer.Apple.com 
<https://developer.apple.com>`_, and with Keychain Access on your Mac computer.

We use the provisioning profiles and P12 certificate to complete building your 
app, and then in 24-48 hours your new branded app is loaded into your account 
on `Customer.owncloud.com <https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud>`_.

The next step is to test your app on your registered iOS devices. When it 
passes testing, the final step is to upload it to your iTunes account for 
distribution.

You will need a lot of graphics for building your app, and for your iTunes 
store listing, in specific sizes and file formats. The ownBrander app and 
iTunes detail all the image specifications you will need.
