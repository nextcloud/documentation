Example installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
========================================

You can use .deb packages to install the required and recommended modules for a typical Nextcloud
installation, using Apache and MariaDB, by issuing the following commands in a
terminal::

    apt install apache2 mariadb-server libapache2-mod-php7.4
    apt install php7.4-gd php7.4-mysql php7.4-curl php7.4-mbstring php7.4-intl
    apt install php7.4-gmp php7.4-bcmath php-imagick php7.4-xml php7.4-zip

* This installs the packages for the Nextcloud core system. 
  If you are planning on running additional apps, keep in mind that they might require additional
  packages.  See :ref:`prerequisites_label` for details.

Now you need to create a database user and the database itself by using the
MySQL command line interface. The database tables will be created by Nextcloud
when you login for the first time.

To start the MySQL command line mode use the following command and press the enter key when prompted for a password::

  mysql -uroot -p

Then a **MariaDB [root]>** prompt will appear. Now enter the following lines, replacing username and password with appropriate values, and confirm them with the enter key:

::

  CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS nextcloud CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

You can quit the prompt by entering::

  quit;

Now download the archive of the latest Nextcloud version:

* Go to the `Nextcloud Download Page <https://nextcloud.com/install>`_.
* Go to **Download Nextcloud Server > Download > Archive file for
  server owners** and download either the tar.bz2 or .zip archive.
* This downloads a file named nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2 or nextcloud-x.y.z.zip
  (where x.y.z is the version number).
* Download its corresponding checksum file, e.g. nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.md5,
  or nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.sha256.
* Verify the MD5 or SHA256 sum::

    md5sum -c nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.md5 < nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    sha256sum -c nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.sha256 < nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    md5sum  -c nextcloud-x.y.z.zip.md5 < nextcloud-x.y.z.zip
    sha256sum  -c nextcloud-x.y.z.zip.sha256 < nextcloud-x.y.z.zip

* You may also verify the PGP signature::

    wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc
    wget https://nextcloud.com/nextcloud.asc
    gpg --import nextcloud.asc
    gpg --verify nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2

* Now you can extract the archive contents. Run the appropriate unpacking
  command for your archive type::

    tar -xjf nextcloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    unzip nextcloud-x.y.z.zip

* This unpacks to a single ``nextcloud`` directory. Copy the Nextcloud directory
  to its final destination. When you are running the Apache HTTP server you may
  safely install Nextcloud in your Apache document root::

    cp -r nextcloud /path/to/webserver/document-root

  where ``/path/to/webserver/document-root`` is replaced by the
  document root of your Web server::

    cp -r nextcloud /var/www

On other HTTP servers it is recommended to install Nextcloud outside of the
document root.
