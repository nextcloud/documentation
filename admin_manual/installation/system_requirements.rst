Server
------

For best performance, stability and functionality we have documented some recommendations for running a Nextcloud server.
The Nextcloud server is not compatible with Windows and macOS.

.. note:: If you plan a setup for your organization and you rely on professional deployment consulting (e.g. efficient and
          reliable scaling) and support, we strongly recommend you to check out our `enterprise support
          <https://nextcloud.com/enterprise/>`_.

Memory
^^^^^^

Memory requirements for running a Nextcloud server are greatly variable,
depending on the numbers of users, apps, files and volume of server activity.

Nextcloud needs a minimum of **128MB** RAM, and we recommend a minimum of **512MB**.

Database requirements for MySQL / MariaDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is currently required if you're running Nextcloud together with a MySQL / MariaDB database:

* InnoDB storage engine (MyISAM is not supported)
* "READ COMMITED" transaction isolation level (See: :ref:`db-transaction-label`)
* Disabled or BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW configured Binary Logging (See: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/binary-log-formats.html)
* For **Emoji (UTF8 4-byte) support** see :doc:`../configuration_database/mysql_4byte_support`

Desktop client
--------------

We strongly recommend using the latest version of your operating system to get the full and most stable experience out
of our clients.

* **Windows** 7+
* **macOS** Lion (10.7)+ (64-bit only)
* **Linux** (CentOS 6.5+, Ubuntu 14.04+, Fedora 21+, openSUSE 13, SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP3+, Debian 8 (Jessie)+, Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 7)

Mobile apps
-----------

We strongly recommend using the latest version of your mobile operating system to get the full and most stable experience out
of our mobile apps.

- **iOS** 9.x+
- **Android** 4.x+

.. note:: The separate Nextcloud Talk app requires iOS 9.x+ or Android 5.x+.

Web browser
-----------

For the best experience with the Nextcloud web interface, we recommend that you use the latest and supported version
of a browser from this list, or one based on those:

- Microsoft **Internet Explorer 11** (latest version)
- Microsoft **Edge**
- Mozilla **Firefox**
- Google **Chrome**/Chromium
- Apple **Safari**

.. note:: If you want to use Nextcloud Talk you should use Mozilla **Firefox** 52+ or Google **Chrome**/Chromium 49+ to have 
          the full experience with video calls and screensharing. Google Chrome/Chromium requires a additional plugin for 
          screensharing.
