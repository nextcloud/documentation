============================
Nextcloud Community Appliance
============================

Nextcloud has a publicly developed community appliance `on GitHub`_. Download the 
latest release from the Appliances tab on the `Nextcloud server installation 
page`_. The easiest way to get the VM up and running is by using `VirtualBox`_ 
and downloading the OVA image from the installation page.

Instructions for VirtualBox and OVA
-----------------------------------

Follow these steps to get the appliance working:

1. Download the Virtual Machine image zip file and unpack it.

2. Start VirtualBox and click on *File ...* > *Import Appliance* and import 
   your new Nextcloud image.
   
3. Click the green Start arrow. After a minute you should see the console 
   greeting message.

4. Note the username and password here. It is a random password that we generate 
   for you on first boot. If you log in at the console, you'll  be prompted to 
   change the password. This is optional.

5. With your Web browser try ``http://localhost:8888`` or 
   ``http://localhost:80`` or the address printed on the console. One of them 
   should work. If not, please review and adjust the network setup of 
   Virtualbox to bridged mode.

6. You should see a Web page with login credentials (if you haven't changed 
   them already) and a list of URLs to try to reach the Nextcloud web 
   service.  Which one works, again depends on the network setup of your 
   hypervisor.

.. note:: You should write down your admin password, and make sure the login 
   credentials are no longer displayed. Click the *[Hide Credentials]* button. 
   When using the Nextcloud Proxy app, this Web page may be publicly visible.

.. note:: Inside the VM, Nextcloud runs with a default disk size of 40 GB and its 
   own MySQL database. The Nextcloud admin user is also a valid account on the 
   Ubuntu system that runs inside the VM. You can administer the VM via SSH.

**For VMware**

You can follow most of the steps above, however, after opening the VMX file, you will have to configure ``Bridged Network`` as *Network Adapter*

Software Appliances
-------------------
