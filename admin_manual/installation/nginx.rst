===================
NGINX configuration
===================

.. warning::
    Please note that web servers other than Apache 2.x are not officially supported.

.. note::
    This page covers example NGINX configurations to run a Nextcloud server.
    These configurations examples were originally provided by `@josh4trunks <https://github.com/josh4trunks>`_
    and are exclusively community-maintained. (Thank you contributors!)

- You need to insert the following code into **your Nginx configuration file**.
  Choose the appropriate example based on whether you are deploying :ref:`nginx_webroot_example` (i.e. :code:`https://cloud.example.com/`) or :ref:`nginx_subdir_example` (i.e. :code:`https://cloud.example.com/nextcloud`).
- Adjust the server directive under :code:`upstream php-handler` to match your PHP installation's configured FPM listener (a misconfiguration here will result in a :code:`502 Bad Gateway` - see :ref:`nginx_php_handler_tips` for details)
- Adjust the existing :code:`server_name` directives found under *both* :code:`server` sections to your real hostname
- Adjust :code:`root` to the webroot of your Nextcloud installation 
- Adjust the :code:`ssl_certificate` and :code:`ssl_certificate_key` directives to the real paths for your signed 
  certificate and private key. Make sure your SSL certificates are readable by the nginx server process (see `nginx HTTPS SSL 
  Module documentation <https://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule>`_).
- Be careful about line breaks if you copy the examples, as long lines may be
  broken for page display and result in an invalid configuration files.
- Some environments might need a ``cgi.fix_pathinfo`` set to ``1`` in their
  ``php.ini``.

.. _nginx_webroot_example:

Nextcloud in the webroot of NGINX
---------------------------------

The following configuration should be used when Nextcloud is placed in the
webroot of your nginx installation. In this example it is
``/var/www/nextcloud`` and it is accessed via ``http(s)://cloud.example.com/``

.. literalinclude:: nginx-root.conf.sample
   :language: nginx

.. _nginx_subdir_example:

Nextcloud in a subdir of the NGINX webroot
------------------------------------------

The following config should be used when Nextcloud is placed within a subdir of
the webroot of your nginx installation.
In this example the Nextcloud files are located at
``/var/www/nextcloud`` and the Nextcloud instance is accessed via ``http(s)://cloud.example.com/nextcloud/``.
The configuration differs from the "Nextcloud in webroot" configuration above in the following ways:

- All requests for ``/nextcloud`` are encapsulated within a single ``location`` block, namely ``location ^~ /nextcloud``.
- The string ``/nextcloud`` is prepended to all prefix paths.
- The root of the domain is mapped to ``/var/www`` rather than ``/var/www/nextcloud``, so that the URI ``/nextcloud`` is mapped to the server directory ``/var/www/nextcloud``.
- The blocks that handle requests for paths outside of ``/nextcloud`` (i.e. ``/robots.txt`` and ``/.well-known``) are pulled out of the ``location ^~ /nextcloud`` block.

Tips and tricks
---------------

.. _nginx_php_handler_tips:

PHP-Handler Configuration / Avoiding "502 Bad Gateway"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :code:`server` line within the :code:`upstream php-handler` above needs to be adjusted to reflect your local PHP FPM configuration. It must match whatever is configured for the :code:`listen` directive within the PHP FPM pool you'll be using for NC.

Many Linux distributions define a listener for a default PHP-FPM pool called :code:`www` in a file called :code:`www.conf` located somewhere like :code:`/etc/php/8.1/pool.d`.

Look for the line that is set to something like: 
 
:code:`listen = /var/run/php/php-fpm.sock`
or
:code:`listen = 127.0.0.1:9000`
 
If PHP FPM will be running on the same host as NGINX (it's probably a safe assumption it will be if you're unsure), it is recommended you use the UNIX socket (i.e. :code:`/var/run/php/php-fpm.sock`) rather than TCP (:code:`127.0.0.1:9000`) for maximum performance (though either will work as long as your NGINX and PHP FPM configurations match).

After deciding how you'd prefer to connect NGINX with PHP FPM (and, if necessary, updating your local PHP FPM configuration and restarting FPM), set your NGINX configuration's :code:`upstream php-handler` :code:`server` to match your preference (Note: If using UNIX sockets, prepend :code:`unix:` in the NGINX configuration, but *not* in your PHP FPM :code:`www.conf`). 

Suppressing log messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're seeing meaningless messages in your logfile, for example ``client
denied by server configuration: /var/www/data/htaccesstest.txt``, add this section to
your nginx configuration to suppress them:

.. code-block:: nginx

        location = /data/htaccesstest.txt {
          allow all;
          log_not_found off;
          access_log off;
        }

JavaScript (.js) or CSS (.css) files not served properly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A common issue with custom nginx configs is that JavaScript (.js)
or CSS (.css) files are not served properly leading to a 404 (File not found)
error on those files and a broken webinterface.

This could be caused by the:

.. code-block:: nginx

        location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {

block shown above not located **below** the:

.. code-block:: nginx

        location ~ \.php(?:$|\/) {

block. Other custom configurations like caching JavaScript (.js)
or CSS (.css) files via gzip could also cause such issues.

Another cause of this issue could be not properly including mimetypes in the
http block, as shown `here. <https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/>`_

Upload of files greater than 10 MiB fails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you configure nginx (globally) to block all requests to (hidden) dot files,
it may be not possible to upload files greater than 10 MiB using the webpage
due to Nextclouds requirement to upload the file to a URL ending with ``/.file``.

You may require to change:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~ /\. {

to the following to re-allow file uploads:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~ /\.(?!file).* {

See `issue #8802 on nextcloud/server <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/8802>`_ for more information.

Other parameters besides the above are relevant to uploading large files (see :ref:`uploading_big_files`).

Login loop without any clue in access.log, error.log, nor nextcloud.log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you after fresh installation (Centos 7 with nginx) have problem with first login, you should as first check these files:

.. code-block:: bash

    tail /var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log
    tail /var/log/nginx/access.log
    tail /var/log/nginx/error.log

If you just see some correct requests in access log, but no login happens, you check access rights for php session and wsdlcache directory. Try to check permissions and execute change if needed:

.. code-block:: bash

    chown nginx:nginx /var/lib/php/session/
    chown root:nginx /var/lib/php/wsdlcache/
    chown root:nginx /var/lib/php/opcache/
