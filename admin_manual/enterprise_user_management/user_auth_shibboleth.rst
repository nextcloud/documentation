========================================
Shibboleth Integration (Enterprise only)
========================================

Introduction
------------

The Nextcloud Shibboleth user backend application integrates Nextcloud with a
Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) and allows operations in federated and
single-sign-on (SSO) infrastructures. Setting up Shibboleth has two big steps:

1. Enable and configure the Apache Shibboleth module.
2. Enable and configure the Nextcloud Shibboleth app.

The Apache Shibboleth module
----------------------------

Currently supported installations are based on the `native Apache integration`_.
The individual configuration of the service provider is highly dependent on
the operating system, as well as on the integration with the Identity
Providers (IdP), and require case-by-case analysis and installation.

A good starting point for the service provider installation can be found in
`the official Shibboleth Wiki`_.

A successful installation and configuration will populate Apache environment
variables with at least a unique user id which is then used by the Nextcloud
Shibboleth app to login a user.

See the `documentation Wiki <https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/wiki/Shibboleth-example-configurations>`_ for more configuration examples.

Apache Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an example configuration as installed and operated on a Linux server
running the Apache 2.4 Web server. These configurations are highly operating system
specific and require a high degree of customization.

The Nextcloud instance itself is installed in ``/var/www/owncloud/``.  The
following aliases are defined in an Apache virtual host directive:

::

	# non-Shibboleth access
	Alias /owncloud /var/www/owncloud/
	# for Shibboleth access
	Alias /oc-shib /var/www/owncloud/

Further Shibboleth specific configuration as defined in
``/etc/apache2/conf.d/shib.conf``::

	#
	# Load the Shibboleth module.
	#
	LoadModule mod_shib /usr/lib64/shibboleth/mod_shib_24.so
	
	#
	# Ensures handler will be accessible.

Depending on the Nextcloud Shibboleth app mode, you may need to revisit this
configuration.

The Nextcloud Shibboleth App
---------------------------

After enabling the Shibboleth app on your Apps page, you need to choose the app
mode and map the necessary Shibboleth environment variables to Nextcloud user
attributes on your Admin page.

.. figure:: ../images/shib-gui5.png
   :alt: Shibboleth configuration screen.

   *figure 1: Enabling Shibboleth on the Nextcloud Admin page*

Choosing the App Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After enabling the app it will be in **Not active** mode, which ignores a 
Shibboleth session and allows you to login as an administrator and inspect the 
currently available Apache environment variables. Use this mode to set up the 
environment mapping for the other modes, and in case you locked yourself out of 
the system. You can also change the app mode and environment mappings by using 
the ``occ`` command, like this example on Ubuntu Linux::

 $ sudo -u www-data php occ shibboleth:mode notactive
 $ sudo -u www-data php occ shibboleth:mapping --uid login

In **Single sign-on only** mode the app checks if the environment variable for 
the Shibboleth session, by default **Shib-Session-Id**, is set. If that is the 
case it will take the value of the environment variable as the ``uid``, by 
default ``eppn``, and check if a user is known by that ``uid``. In effect, this 
allows another user backend, eg. the LDAP app, to provide the ``displayname``, 
``email`` and ``avatar``.

 .. note:: As an example the IdP can send the **sAMAccountName** which the
    Apache Shibboleth module writes to a custom Apache environment variable
    called ``login``. The Nextcloud Shibboleth app reads that ``login``
    environment variable and tries to find an LDAP user with that ``uid``. For 
    this to work the LDAP backend also needs to be configured to use the
    **sAMAccountName** as the **Internal Username Attribute** in the
    :doc:`LDAP expert settings <../configuration_user/user_auth_ldap>`.

 .. note:: In many scenarios Shibboleth is not intended to hide the user's
    password from the service provider, but only to implement SSO. If that is
    the case it is sufficient to protect the Nextcloud base url with Shibboleth.
    This will send Web users to the IdP but allow desktop and mobile clients to
    continue using username and password, preventing popups due to an expired
    Shibboleth session lifetime.

In **Autoprovision Users** mode the app will not ask another user backend, but
instead provision users on the fly by reading the two additional environment
variables for display name and email address.

.. figure:: ../images/shib-gui6.png
   :alt: Dropdowns for mapping Shibboleth environment configuration variables to Nextcloud user attributes.

   *figure 2: Mapping Shibboleth environment configuration variables to Nextcloud 
   user attributes*

In Nextcloud 8.1 the Shibboleth environment variable mapping was stored in
``apps/user_shibboleth/config.php``. This file was overwritten on upgrades,
preventing a seamless upgrade procedure. In Nextcloud 8.2+ the variables are
stored in the Nextcloud database, making Shibboleth automatically upgradeable.

Shibboleth with Desktop and Mobile Clients
------------------------------------------

The Nextcloud Desktop Client can interact with an
Nextcloud instance running inside a Shibboleth Service Provider by using built-in
browser components for authentication against the IdP.

The regular Nextcloud Android and iOS mobile apps do not work with Shibboleth.
However, customers who create
:doc:`branded mobile apps with ownBrander
<../enterprise_clients/creating_branded_apps>`
have the option to enable SAML authentication in ownBrander.

Enterprise customers also have the option to request a regular Nextcloud
mobile client built to use Shibboleth from their Nextcloud account
representatives.

The Nextcloud desktop sync client and mobile apps store users' logins, so
your users only need to enter their logins the first time they set up their
accounts.

.. note:: The Nextcloud clients may use only a single Shibboleth login per
   Nextcloud server; multi-account is not supported with Shibboleth.

These screenshots show what the user sees at account setup. Figure 1
shows a test Shibboleth login screen from
`Testshib.org <https://www.testshib.org/index.html>`_ on the Nextcloud desktop
sync client.

.. figure:: ../images/shib-gui1.png
   :alt: First client login screen.

   *figure 3: First login screen*

Then after going through the setup wizard, the desktop sync client displays the
server and login information just like it does for any other Nextcloud server
connections.

.. figure:: ../images/shib-gui4.png
   :alt: The Nextcloud client shows which server you are connected to.

   *figure 4: Nextcloud client displays server information*

To your users, it doesn't look or behave differently on the desktop sync
client, Android app, or iOS app from an ordinary Nextcloud account setup. The
only difference is the initial setup screen where they enter their account
login.

WebDAV Support
--------------

Users of standard WebDAV clients can use an alternative
WebDAV Url, for example ``https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/nonshib-webdav/``
to log in with their username and password. The password is generated on the
Personal settings page.

.. image:: ../images/shibboleth-personal.png

.. note:: In **Single sign-on only** mode the alternative WebDAV Url feature 
   will not work, as we have no way to store the WebDAV password. Instead the 
   normal WebDAV endpoint can be omittet from the Shibboleth authentication, 
   allowing WebDAV clients to use normal username and password based 
   authentication. That includes the desktop and mobile clients.

For provisioning purpose an OCS API has been added to revoke a generated
password for a user:

Syntax: ``/v1/cloud/users/{userid}/non_shib_password``

* HTTP method: DELETE

Status codes:

* 100 - successful
* 998 - user unknown

Example:

::

	$ curl -X DELETE "https://cloud.example.com/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/myself@testshib.org/non_shib_password" -u admin:admin
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<ocs>
	 <meta>
	  <status>ok</status>
	  <statuscode>100</statuscode>
	  <message/>
	 </meta>
	 <data/>
	</ocs>


Known Limitations
-----------------

Encryption
^^^^^^^^^^

File encryption can only be used together with Shibboleth when the 
:ref:`master key-based encryption <occ_encryption_label>` is used because the 
per- user encryption requires the user's password to unlock the private 
encryption key. Due to the nature of Shibboleth the user's password is not known 
to the service provider.

Other Login Mechanisms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can allow other login mechanisms (e.g. LDAP or Nextcloud native) by creating
a second Apache virtual host configuration. This second location is not
protected by Shibboleth, and you can use your other Nextcloud login mechanisms.

Session Timeout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Session timeout on Shibboleth is controlled by the IdP. It is not possible to
have a session length longer than the length controlled by the IdP. In extreme
cases this could result in re-login on mobile clients and desktop clients every
hour.

The session timeout can be overridden in the service provider, but this
requires a source code change of the Apache Shibboleth module. A patch can be
provided by the Nextcloud support team.

UID Considerations and Windows Network Drive compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using ``user_shibboleth`` in **Single sign-on only** mode, together with
``user_ldap``, both apps need to resolve to the same ``uid``.
``user_shibboleth`` will do the authentication, and ``user_ldap`` will provide
user details such as ``email`` and ``displayname``. In the case of Active
Directory, multiple attributes can be used as the ``uid``. But they all have
different implications to take into account:

**sAMAccountName**

* *Example:* jfd
* *Uniqueness:* Domain local, might change e.g. marriage
* *Other implications:* Works with ``windows_network_drive`` app

**userPrincipalName**

* *Example:* jfd@owncloud.com
* *Uniqueness:* Forest local, might change on eg. marriage
* *Other implications:* TODO check WND compatibility

**objectSid**

* *Example:* S-1-5-21-2611707862-2219215769-354220275-1137
* *Uniqueness:* Domain local, changes when the user is moved to a new domain
* *Other implications:* Incompatible with ``windows_network_drive`` app

**sIDHistory**

* *Example:* Multi-value
* *Uniqueness:* Contains previous objectSIDs
* *Other implications:* Incompatible with ``windows_network_drive`` app

**objectGUID**

* *Example:* 47AB881D-0655-414D-982F-02998C905A28
* *Uniqueness:* Globally unique
* *Other implications:* Incompatible with ``windows_network_drive`` app

Keep in mind that Nextcloud will derive the home folder from the ``uid``, unless
a home folder naming rule is in place. The only truly stable attribute is the
``objectGUID``, so that should be used. If not for the ``uid`` then at least as
the home folder naming rule. The tradeoff here is that if you want to use
``windows_network_drive`` you are bound to the ``sAMAccountName``, as that is
used as the login.

Also be aware that using ``user_shibboleth`` in **Autoprovision Users** mode
will not allow you to use SSO for additional ``user_ldap`` users,
because ``uid`` collisions will be detected by ``user_ldap``.
