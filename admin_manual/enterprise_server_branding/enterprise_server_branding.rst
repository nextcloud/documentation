Custom Theming Nextcloud (Enterprise only)
=========================================

Overview
--------

ownBrander is an Nextcloud build service that is exclusive to Enterprise 
edition customers for creating branded Nextcloud clients and servers. You 
may brand your Nextcloud server using ownBrander to easily build a custom theme, 
using your own logo and artwork. Nextcloud has always been theme-able, but it was 
a manual process that required editing CSS and PHP files. Now Enterprise 
customers can use ownBrander, which provides an easy graphical wizard. 

You need an Enterprise subscription, an account on 
`Customer.owncloud.com <https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud>`_, and the 
ownBrander app enabled on your account. When you 
complete the steps in the wizard the ownBrander service builds your new branded 
theme, and in 24-48 hours you'll see it in your account.

When you open the ownBrander app, go to the Web tab. You will see an 
introduction and the wizard, which starts with uploading your logo. You will 
need a number of images in specific sizes and formats, and the wizard tells you 
what you need. Example images are on the right, and you can click to enlarge 
them.

.. note:: If you see errors when you upload SVG files, such as "Incorrect 
   extension.File type image/svg+xml is not correct", "This SVG is invalid", 
   or "Error uploading file: Incorrect size", try opening the file in 
   `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/en/>`_ then save as "Plain SVG" and 
   upload your SVG image again.

The wizard has two sections. The first section contains all the required 
elements: logos and other artwork, colors, naming, and your enterprise URL. The 
Suggested section contains optional items such as additional logo placements 
and custom URLs.

When you are finished, click the **Generate Web Server** button. If you want to 
change anything, go ahead and change it and click the **Generate Web Server** 
button. This will override your previous version, if it has not been created 
yet.In 24-48 hours you'll find your new branded theme in the **Web** folder in 
your `Customer.owncloud.com <https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud>`_ account. 

Inside the **Web** folder you'll find a **themes** folder. Copy this to your 
``owncloud/themes`` directory. You may name your **themes** folder anything you 
want, for example ``myBrandedTheme``. Then configure your Nextcloud server to 
use your branded theme by entering it in your ``config.php`` file::

 "theme" => "myBrandedTheme"

If anything goes wrong with your new theme, comment out this line to re-enable 
the default theme until you fix your branded theme. The branded theme follows 
the same file structure as the default theme, and you may further customize it 
by editing the source files. 

.. Note:: Always edit only your custom theme files. Never edit the default 
   theme files.
