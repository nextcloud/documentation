==================
Retention of files
==================

Nextcloud's Files Retention app allows to automatically delete files that
are tagged with a collaborative tag and have a certain age.

Sample
------

       :alt: Sample rule to delete files after 14 days.

The rule from the sample will delete all files tagged with ``Temporary file`` after 14 days.

Common misconfigurations
------------------------

Public collaborative tag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to :doc:`access_control` retention should use ``restricted`` or ``invisible``
tags. Otherwise any user can remove the tag and the file is not removed after the given
period. Use :doc:`automated_tagging` to assign such tags to newly uploaded files.

File age
^^^^^^^^

Currently retention is based on the creation date of the file. The sync client sends
the **original** creation date to the server, while uploading through the web interface
will create a new file with a **new** creation date.
We hope to be able to add a ``upload date`` to the filesystem soon, which would make more
sense. Until then this potentially unexpected behavior has to be taken into account.
