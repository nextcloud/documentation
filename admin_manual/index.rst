**Welcome to the Nextcloud Server Administration Guide.**

This guide explains how to perform administrative tasks in Nextcloud, a highly versatile and scalable open-source platform for file synchronization and content collaboration. 

With over 400,000 deployments, Nextcloud can run on a simple two-user Raspberry Pi or scale to support global, distributed installations serving tens of millions of users. It can be deployed on-premises, in private or public clouds, or in hybrid environments. Supported by a large and growing community, Nextcloud is available in more than 60 languages.

.. admonition:: Who develops Nextcloud?

  The development of the Nextcloud platform is a cooperative
  endeavor overseen by the core maintainers -- primarily
  employed by Nextcloud GmbH -- along with thousands of
  partners, providers, collaborators, project members, and 
  community participants.

  The Nextcloud community includes everyone -- from individual 
  users and independent developers to large organizations.

  Community members share and discuss their experiences with 
  the platform every day. They suggest improvements, 
  collaborate on design, write code, create documentation, 
  test for bugs, triage bug reports and enhancement ideas, 
  support others, improve translations, and help fund and 
  organize the logistics of a project this size. Most 
  importantly, they use Nextcloud in their daily lives and 
  work.
