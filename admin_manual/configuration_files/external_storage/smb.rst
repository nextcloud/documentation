SMB/CIFS
========

Nextcloud can connect to Windows file servers or other SMB-compatible servers
with the SMB/CIFS backend.

.. note:: The SMB/CIFS backend requires ``smbclient`` or 
   the PHP smbclient module to be installed on the Nextcloud server. The PHP 
   smbclient module is preferred, but either will work. These 
   should be included in any Linux distribution. (See `PECL smbclient 
   <https://pecl.php.net/package/smbclient>`_ if your distro does not include 
   them.)

You need the following information:

*    Folder name for your local mountpoint.
*    Host: The URL of the Samba server.
*    Username: The username or domain/username used to login to the Samba 
     server.
*    Password: the password to login to the Samba server.
*    Share: The share on the Samba server to mount.
*    Remote Subfolder: The remote subfolder inside the Samba share to mount 
     (optional, defaults to /). To assign the Nextcloud logon username 
     automatically to the subfolder, use ``$user`` instead of a particular 
     subfolder name. 
*    And finally, the Nextcloud users and groups who get access to the share.

Optionally, you can specify a ``Domain``. This is useful in 
cases where the
SMB server requires a domain and a username, and an advanced authentication
mechanism like session credentials is used so that the username cannot be
modified. This is concatenated with the username, so the backend gets
``domain\username``

.. note:: For improved reliability and performance, we recommended installing   
          ``libsmbclient-php``, a native PHP module for connecting to
          SMB servers.
