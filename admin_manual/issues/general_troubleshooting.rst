.. TODO ON RELEASE: Update version number above on release

General troubleshooting
-----------------------

Check the Nextcloud :doc:`../installation/system_requirements`, especially
supported browser versions.

When you see warnings about ``code integrity``, refer to :doc:`code_signing`.

Disable 3rdparty / non-shipped apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It might be possible that 3rd party / non-shipped apps are causing various
different issues. Always disable 3rd party apps before upgrades, and for
troubleshooting. Please refer to the :ref:`apps_commands_label` on how
to disable an app from command line.

Nextcloud logfiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a standard Nextcloud installation the log level is set to ``Normal``. To find
any issues you need to raise the log level to ``All`` in your ``config.php``
file, or to **Everything** on your Nextcloud Admin page. Please see
:doc:`../configuration_server/logging_configuration` for more information on
these log levels.

Some logging - for example JavaScript console logging - needs debugging
enabled. Edit :file:`config/config.php` and change ``'debug' => false,`` to
``'debug' => true,`` Be sure to change it back when you are finished.

For JavaScript issues you will also need to view the javascript console. All
major browsers have developer tools for viewing the console, and you
usually access them by pressing F12.

.. note:: The logfile of Nextcloud is located in the data directory
   ``nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log``.

.. _label-phpinfo:

PHP version and information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to know the PHP version and configuration that is in-use on your 
Nextcloud server. This will not necessarily be the same version and configuration as 
can be reached from the command-line. The simplest way to gather this information is 
by using what's commonly referenced as ``phpinfo()``.

The most accurate - and easiest - way to access ``phpinfo`` is by checking it from 
within Nextcloud itself. Of course, this requires that Nextcloud is functioning 
enough that you can log in as an administrator and access the 
**Administration settings -> System** menu. If so, you can enable the exposure of 
``phpinfo`` data by toggling it on via ``occ``:

``./occ config:app:set --value=yes serverinfo phpinfo``

From then on a new button labeled **Show phpinfo** will be visible in the web 
interface under **Administration settings -> System**. Clicking it will expose 
just about everything you may want to know about your PHP environment.

If accessing the Nextcloud web interface is not an option, you may create a
plain-text file named **phpinfo.php** and place it in your Web root, for
example ``/var/www/html/phpinfo.php``. (Your Web root may be in a different
location; your Linux distribution documentation will tell you where.) This file
contains just this line::

 <?php phpinfo(); ?>

Open this file in a Web browser by pointing your browser to
``localhost/phpinfo.php``:

.. figure:: ../images/phpinfo.png

Your PHP version is at the top, and the rest of the page contains abundant
system information such as active modules, active ``.ini`` files, and much more.
When you are finished reviewing your information you must delete
``phpinfo.php``, or move it outside of your Web directory, because it is a
security risk to expose such sensitive data.

Debugging sync issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: The data directory on the server is exclusive to Nextcloud and must
   not be modified manually.

Disregarding this can lead to unwanted behaviors like:

* Problems with sync clients
* Undetected changes due to caching in the database

If you need to directly upload files from the same server please use a WebDAV
command line client like ``cadaver`` to upload files to the WebDAV interface at:

``https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav``

Common problems / error messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some common problems / error messages found in your logfiles as described above:

* ``SQLSTATE[HY000] [1040] Too many connections`` -> You need to increase the
  connection limit of your database, please refer to the manual of your database
  for more information.
* ``SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 5 database is locked`` -> You're using
  ``SQLite``
  which can't handle a lot of parallel requests. Please consider converting to
  another database like described in
  :doc:`../configuration_database/db_conversion`.
* ``SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away`` -> Please
  refer to :ref:`db-troubleshooting-label` for more information.
* ``SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory`` -> There is a problem
  accessing your SQLite database file in your data directory
  (``data/nextcloud.db``). Please check the permissions of this folder/file or
  if it exists at all. If you're using MySQL please start your database.
* ``Connection closed / Operation cancelled`` -> This could be caused by wrong
  ``KeepAlive`` settings within your Apache config. Make sure that
  ``KeepAlive`` is set to ``On`` and  also try to raise the limits of
  ``KeepAliveTimeout`` and  ``MaxKeepAliveRequests``.
* ``No basic authentication headers were found`` -> This error is shown in your
  ``data/nextcloud.log`` file. Some Apache modules like ``mod_fastcgi``, ``mod_fcgid``
  or ``mod_proxy_fcgi`` are not passing the needed authentication headers to
  PHP and so the login to Nextcloud via WebDAV, CalDAV and CardDAV clients is
  failing.

Troubleshooting Web server and PHP problems
-------------------------------------------

Logfiles
^^^^^^^^

When having issues the first step is to check the logfiles provided by PHP, the
Web server and Nextcloud itself.

.. note:: In the following the paths to the logfiles of a default Debian
   installation running Apache2 with mod_php is assumed. On other Web servers,
   Linux distros or operating systems they can differ.

* The logfile of Apache2 is located in ``/var/log/apache2/error.log``.
* The logfile of PHP can be configured in your ``/etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini``.
  You need to set the directive ``log_errors`` to ``On`` and choose the path
  to store the logfile in the ``error_log`` directive. After those changes you
  need to restart your Web server.
* The logfile of Nextcloud is located in the data directory
  ``/var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log``.

Web server and PHP modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: Lighttpd is not supported with Nextcloud, and some Nextcloud features
   may not work at all on Lighttpd.

There are some Web server or PHP modules which are known to cause various
problems like broken uploads/downloads. The following shows a draft overview of
these modules:

1. Apache

* mod_pagespeed
* mod_evasive
* mod_security
* mod_reqtimeout
* mod_deflate
* libapache2-mod-php*filter (use libapache2-mod-php8.0 instead)
* mod_spdy together with libapache2-mod-php5 / mod_php (use fcgi or php-fpm
  instead)
* mod_dav
* mod_xsendfile / X-Sendfile (causing broken downloads if not configured
  correctly)

2. NginX

* ngx_pagespeed
* HttpDavModule
* X-Sendfile (causing broken downloads if not configured correctly)

3. PHP

* eAccelerator

.. _trouble-webdav-label:

Troubleshooting WebDAV
----------------------

Nextcloud uses SabreDAV, and the SabreDAV documentation is comprehensive and
helpful.

.. note: Lighttpd is not supported on Nextcloud, and Lighttpd WebDAV does not
   work with Nextcloud.

See:

* `SabreDAV FAQ <http://sabre.io/dav/faq/>`_
* `Web servers <http://sabre.io/dav/webservers>`_ (Lists lighttpd as not
  recommended)
* `Working with large files <http://sabre.io/dav/large-files/>`_ (Shows a PHP
  bug in older SabreDAV versions and information for mod_security problems)
* `0 byte files <http://sabre.io/dav/0bytes>`_ (Reasons for empty files on the
  server)
* `Clients <http://sabre.io/dav/clients/>`_ (A comprehensive list of WebDAV
  clients, and possible problems with each one)
* `Finder, OS X's built-in WebDAV client
  <http://sabre.io/dav/clients/finder/>`_
  (Describes problems with Finder on various Web servers)

There is also a well maintained FAQ thread available at the `ownCloud Forums
<https://central.owncloud.org/t/how-to-fix-caldav-carddav-webdav-problems/852>`_
which contains various additional information about WebDAV problems.

.. _service-discovery-label:

Service discovery
-----------------

Some clients - especially on iOS/macOS - have problems finding the proper
sync URL, even when explicitly configured to use it.

If you want to use CalDAV or CardDAV clients or other clients that require service discovery
together with Nextcloud it is important to have a correct working setup of the following
URLs:

| ``https://example.com/.well-known/carddav``
| ``https://example.com/.well-known/caldav``
|

Those need to be redirecting your clients to the correct endpoints. If Nextcloud
is running at the document root of your Web server the correct URL is
``https://example.com/remote.php/dav`` for CardDAV and CalDAV and if running in a
subfolder like ``nextcloud``, then ``https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav``.

For the first case the :file:`.htaccess` file shipped with Nextcloud should do
this work for you when you're running Apache. You need to make sure that your
Web server is using this file. Additionally, you need the mod_rewrite Apache
module installed and ``AllowOverride All`` set in your :file:`apache2.conf`
or vHost-file to process these redirects. When running Nginx please refer to
:doc:`../installation/nginx`.


If your Nextcloud instance is installed in a subfolder called ``nextcloud`` and
you're running Apache, create or edit the :file:`.htaccess` file within the
document root of your Web server and add the following lines::

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteRule ^\.well-known/carddav /nextcloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]
      RewriteRule ^\.well-known/caldav /nextcloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]
      RewriteRule ^\.well-known/webfinger /nextcloud/index.php/.well-known/webfinger [R=301,L]
      RewriteRule ^\.well-known/nodeinfo /nextcloud/index.php/.well-known/nodeinfo [R=301,L]
    </IfModule>

Make sure to change /nextcloud to the actual subfolder your Nextcloud instance is running in.

.. note:: If you put the above directives directly into an Apache
   configuration file (usually within ``/etc/apache2/``)
   instead of ``.htaccess``, you need to prepend the first argument of
   each ``RewriteRule`` option with a forward slash ``/``, for example
   ``^/\.well-known/carddav``.
   This is because Apache normalizes paths for the use in ``.htaccess``
   files by dropping any number of leading slashes, but it does not
   do so for the use in its main configuration files.

If you are running NGINX, make sure ``location = /.well-known/carddav {`` and ``location = /.well-known/caldav {`` are properly configured as described in :doc:`../installation/nginx`, adapt to use a subfolder if necessary.

Now change the URL in the client settings to just use:

``https://example.com``

instead of e.g.

``https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav/principals/username``.

There are also several techniques to remedy this, which are described extensively at
the `Sabre DAV website <http://sabre.io/dav/service-discovery/>`_.

Troubleshooting sharing
-----------------------------------

Users' Federated Cloud IDs not updated after a domain name change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. run Database query

| ``DELETE FROM oc_cards_properties WHERE name = 'CLOUD' AND addressbookid = (select id from oc_addressbooks where principaluri = 'principals/system/system' AND uri = 'system');``

2. run occ commands

| ``occ dav:sync-system-addressbook``
| ``occ federation:sync-addressbooks``

.. _trouble-file-encoding-ext-storages:

Troubleshooting file encoding on external storages
--------------------------------------------------

When using external storage, it can happen that some files with special characters will not
appear in the file listing, or they will appear and not be accessible.

When this happens, please run the :ref:`files scanner<occ_files_scan_label>`, for example with::

  sudo -u www-data php occ files:scan --all

If the scanner tells about an encoding issue on the affected file, please enable Mac encoding compatibility in the :ref:`mount options<external_storage_mount_options_label>`
and then :ref:`rescan the external storage<occ_files_scan_label>`.

.. note::
   This mode comes with a performance impact because Nextcloud will always try both encodings when detecting files
   on external storages.

   Mac computers are using the NFD Unicode Normalization for file names which is different than NFC, the one used
   by other operating systems. Mac users might upload files directly to the external storage using NFD normalized
   file names. When uploading through Nextcloud, file names will always be normalized to the NFC standard for consistency.

   It is recommended to let Nextcloud use external storages exclusively to avoid such issues.

   See also `technical explanation about NFC vs NFD normalizations <https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/uc/nfc_vs_nfd.html>`_.

Troubleshooting contacts & calendar
-----------------------------------

Unable to update contacts or events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you get an error like:

``PATCH https://example.com/remote.php/dav HTTP/1.0 501 Not Implemented``

it is likely caused by one of the following reasons:

Using Pound reverse-proxy/load balancer
  As of writing this Pound doesn't support the HTTP/1.1 verb.
  Pound is easily `patched
  <http://www.apsis.ch/pound/pound_list/archive/2013/2013-08/1377264673000>`_
  to support HTTP/1.1.

Misconfigured Web server
  Your Web server is misconfigured and blocks the needed DAV methods.
  Please refer to :ref:`trouble-webdav-label` above for troubleshooting steps.

Troubleshooting data-directory
------------------------------

If you have a fresh install, consider reinstalling with your preferred directory location.

Unofficially moving the data directory can be done as follows:

1. Make sure no cron jobs are running
2. Stop apache
3. Move /data to the new location
4. Change the config.php entry
5. Edit the database: In oc_storages change the path on the local::/old-data-dir/ entry
6. Ensure permissions are still correct
7. Restart apache

.. warning::
   However this is not supported and you risk breaking your database.

For a safe moving of data directory, supported by Nextcloud, recommended actions are:

1. Make sure no cron jobs are running
2. Stop apache
3. Move /data to the new location
4. Create a symlink from the original location to the new location
5. Ensure permissions are still correct
6. Restart apache

.. warning::
   Note, you may need to configure your webserver to support symlinks.

Troubleshooting quota or size issues
------------------------------------

Sometimes it can happen that the used space reported in the web UI or with ``occ user:info $userId``
does not match the actual data stored in the user's ``data/$userId/files`` directory.

.. note::

   Metadata, versions, trashbin and encryption keys are not counted in the used space above.
   Please refer to the `quota documentation <https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/files/quota.html>`_ for details.

.. TODO ON RELEASE: Update version number above on release

Running the following command can help fix the sizes and quota for a given user::

 sudo -u www-data php occ files:scan -vvv <user-id>

If **encryption was enabled earlier on the instance and disabled later on**, it is likely that some
size values in the database did not correctly get reset upon decrypting.
You can run the following SQL query to reset those after **backing up the database**:

.. code-block:: sql

 UPDATE oc_filecache SET unencrypted_size=0 WHERE encrypted=0; 

Troubleshooting downloading or decrypting files
-----------------------------------------------

Bad signature error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some rare cases it can happen that encrypted files cannot be downloaded
and return a "500 Internal Server Error". If the Nextcloud log contains an error about
"Bad Signature", then the following command can be used to repair affected files::

 occ encryption:fix-encrypted-version userId --path=/path/to/broken/file.txt

Replace "userId" and the path accordingly.
The command will do a test decryption for all files and automatically repair the ones with a signature error.

.. _troubleshooting_encryption_key_not_found:

Encryption key cannot be found
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the logs contain an error stating that the encryption key cannot be found, you can manually search the data directory for a folder that has the same name as the file name.
For example if a file "example.md" cannot be decrypted, run::

    find path/to/datadir -name example.md -type d

Then check the results located in the ``files_encryption`` folder.
If the key folder is in the wrong location, you can move it to the correct folder and try again.

The ``data/files_encryption`` folder contains encryption keys for group folders and system-wide external storages
while ``data/$userid/files_encryption`` contains the keys for specific user storage files.

.. note::

   This can happen if encryption was disabled at some point but the :ref:`occ command for decrypt-all<occ_disable_encryption_label>` was not run, and
   then someone moved the files to another location. Since encryption was disabled, the keys did not get moved.

Encryption key cannot be found with external storage or group folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To resolve this issue, please run the following command::

    sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:fix-key-location <user-id>

This will attempt to recover keys that were not moved properly.

If this doesn't resolve the problem, please refer to the section :ref:`Encryption key cannot be found<troubleshooting_encryption_key_not_found>` for a manual procedure.

.. note::

   There were two known issues where:

   - moving files between an encrypted and non-encrypted storage like external storage or group folder `would not move the keys with the files <https://github.com/nextcloud/groupfolders/issues/1896>`_.
   - putting files on system-wide external storage would store the keys in the `wrong location <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/32690>`_.

Fair Use Policy
---------------

Nextcloud is open source and you can host it for free on your own server or at a provider.

Nextcloud recommends Using Nextcloud Enterprise for deploying instances with more than 500 users. With that size, issues like a broken server or a data leak become very serious.

If there is an issue with the server, 500 people can't work. A data leak would risk the data of many users. In short, the server should be considered mission-critical. We believe you and your users would have a better experience with Nextcloud Enterprise.

Nextcloud Enterprise is pre-configured and optimised for the needs of professional organisations rather than home users. It comes with support, security and scaling benefits, compliance expertise, and access to our knowledge about running a successful Nextcloud, to get the best possible experience for users and admins. This also reduces the load on our home user forum http://help.nextcloud.com from issues unique to big deployments.

Nextcloud provides some infrastructure components needed for Nextcloud servers to run reliably. This includes notification, our app store and more. To ensure these resources do not get overloaded by administrators who run Nextcloud for thousands of users without providing financial resources to Nextcloud in return, these components are limited and will not work for more than 500 users.

We believe all organisations who run Nextcloud for hundreds of users should be officially supported. We know there can be financial restrictions for non-profit organisations and, as we want everybody to have a chance to get the most out of Nextcloud, we have special offers for NGOs, small schools and other non-profits. Please reach out to talk to us about what is possible through the `contact form on our site <https://nextcloud.com/contact/>`_ or ask your system administrator to reach out.

Other issues
------------

Some services like *Cloudflare* can cause issues by minimizing JavaScript
and loading it only when needed. When having issues like a not working
login button or creating new users make sure to disable such services
first.
