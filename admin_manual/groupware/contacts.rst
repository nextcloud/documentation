==================
Contacts / CardDAV
==================

Nextcloud ships a CardDAV backend for users to store and share their address books and contacts.

.. _system-address-book:

System Address Book
-------------------

.. versionchanged:: 27
    The system address book is now accessible to all Nextcloud users

Nextcloud maintains a read-only address book containing contact information of all users of the instance.

Disabled users are removed from this address book.

You can disable or enable access to the system address book by using the administration interface or with a command line command.

Please note that this does not influence :ref:`Federated sharing<label-direct-share-link>`.

Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run ``occ config:app:set dav system_addressbook_exposed --value="no"`` to disable access to the system address book for all users.

Administration interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate to *Administration Settings* -> *Groupware* -> *System Address Book* section and toggle the *Enable system address book* option.


.. warning:: If clients have already connected to the CalDAV endpoint, the clients might experience sync issues after system address book access was disabled. This can often be remedied by choosing a different default address book on the client and forcing a resync.

Privacy and User Property Scopes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contact information in the system address book is taken from users' :ref:`profile information<profile>`. Profile properties are only written to the system contact if the :ref:`scope<profile-property-scopes>` is set to *Local* or higher.

Users who set all their property scopes to *Private* are removed from the system address book and therefore not seen by other users.

:ref:`File sharing settings<file-sharing-configuration>` controls the enumeration of other users.

* If username autocompletion is not allowed, the system address book will only show user's own system contact but no other contacts.
* If username autocompletion is allowed, users will see contact cards for all other users.

  * If autocompletion is limited to users within the same groups, users will see contact cards for other users in shared groups.
  * If autocompletion is limited to matching phone numbers, the system address book will only show user's own system contact but no other contacts.
  * If autocompletion is limited to users within the same groups **and** matching phone numbers, users will see contact cards for other users in shared groups.

Address Book Sync
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The address book is updated automatically with every added, modified, disabled or removed user. Admins can also trigger a full rewrite of the address book :ref:`with occ<occ-dav-sync-system-address-book>`.

Shared items
------------

.. versionadded:: 5.5.0

For this feature, the shipped `related resources app <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/related_resources>`_ needs to be enabled.

Rate limits
-----------

Nextcloud rate limits the creation of address books and how many can be created in a short period of time. The default is 10 address books per hour. This can be customized as follows::

  # Set limit to 15 items per 30 minutes
  php occ config:app:set dav rateLimitAddressBookCreation --type=integer --value=15
  php occ config:app:set dav rateLimitPeriodAddressBookCreation --type=integer --value=1800

Additionally, the maximum number of address books a user may create is limited to 10 items. This can be customized too::

  # Allow users to create 50 addressbooks
  php occ config:app:set dav maximumAdressbooks --type=integer --value=50

or::

  # Allow users to create address books without restriction
  php occ config:app:set dav maximumAdressbooks --type=integer --value=-1

Example contact
---------------

.. versionadded:: 32.0.0

The example contact administration setting allows you to enable the creation of a contact in the user's address book when they log in for the first time.
To enable the example contact feature:

1. Navigate to the Groupware settings in the admin settings.
2. Scroll down to the "Example content" section.
3. Enable the "Example contact" setting with the checkbox 

If you want to set a specific contact that should be created.

4. Press the "Import contact" button.
5. Choose a vCard file (.vcf) that should be imported as an example contact.

Switching back to the default example contact provided by nextcloud is possible by pressing the "Reset to default contact" button.

.. note::
    Example contacts will only be created for users that log in for the first time after the feature was enabled.
