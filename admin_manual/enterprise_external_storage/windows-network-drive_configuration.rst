Installing and Configuring the Windows Network Drive App
========================================================

The Windows Network Drive app creates a control panel on your Admin page for 
seamless mounting of SMB/CIFS file shares on Nextcloud servers.

Any Windows file share, and Samba servers on Linux and other Unix-type operating 
systems use the SMB/CIFS file-sharing protocol. The files and directories on the 
SMB/CIFS server will be visible on your Files page just like your other Nextcloud 
files and folders. They are labeled with a little four-pane Windows-style icon, 
and the left pane of your Files page includes a Windows Network Drive filter. 
Figure 1 shows a new Windows Network Drive share marked with red warnings. 
These indicate that Nextcloud cannot connect to the share because it requires 
the user to login, it is not available, or there is an error in the 
configuration.

Files are synchronized bi-directionally, and you can create, upload, and delete 
files and folders. Nextcloud server admins can create Windows Network Drive 
mounts, and optionally allow users to create their own personal Windows Network 
Drive mounts. 

Depending on the authentication method, passwords for each mount are encrypted 
and stored in the Nextcloud database, using a long random secret key stored in 
``config.php``, which allows Nextcloud to access the shares when the users who 
own the mounts are not logged in. Or, passwords are not stored and available 
only for the current session, which adds security.

Installation
------------

Enable the Windows Network Drive app on your Nextcloud Apps page. Then there are 
a few dependencies to install.

You must install the Nextcloud ``php5-libsmbclient`` binary; please refer to the README in 
your `customer.owncloud.com <https://customer.owncloud.com/>`_ account for instructions 
on obtaining it.

You also need the Samba client installed on your Linux system. This is included in 
all Linux distributions; on Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian derivatives this 
is ``smbclient``. On SUSE, Red Hat, CentOS, and other Red Hat derivatives it is 
``samba-client``.

Creating a New Share
--------------------

When you create a new WND share you need the login credentials for the share, 
the server address, the share name, and the folder you want to connect to. 

1. First enter the Nextcloud mountpoint for your new WND share. This must not be 
   an existing folder.
2. Then select your authentication method; See :doc:`enterprise_only_auth` for 
   complete information on the five available authentication methods.

   *Figure 2: WND mountpoint and authorization credentials.*    
   
3. Enter the address of the server that contains the WND share.
4. The Windows share name.
5. The root folder of the share. This is the folder name, or the 
   ``$user`` variable for user's home directories. Note that the LDAP 
   ``Internal Username Attribute`` must be set to the ``samaccountname`` for 
   either the share or the root to work, and the user's home directory needs 
   to match the ``samaccountname``. (See 
   :doc:`../configuration_user/user_auth_ldap`.)
6. Login credentials.
7. Select users or groups with access to the share. The default is all users.
8. Click the gear icon for additional mount options. Note that encryption is 
   enabled by default, while sharing is not. Sharing is not available for all 
   authorization methods; see :doc:`enterprise_only_auth`.

Your changes are saved automatically.

.. note:: When you create a new mountpoint using Login credentials you must log 
   out of Nextcloud, and then log back in so you can access the share. You 
   only have to do this the first time.

Personal WND Mounts
-------------------

Users create their own personal WND mounts on their Personal pages. These are 
created the same way as Admin-created shares. Users have four options for 
login credentials: 

* Username and password
* Log-in credentials, save in session
* Log-in credentials, save in database
* Global credentials

libsmclient Issues
------------------

If your Linux distribution ships with ``libsmbclient 3.x``, which is included in 
the Samba client, you may need to set up the HOME variable in Apache to prevent 
a segmentation fault. If you have ``libsmbclient 4.1.6`` and higher it doesn't 
seem to be an issue, so you won't have to change your HOME variable.

To set up the HOME variable on Ubuntu, modify the ``/etc/apache2/envvars`` 
file::

  unset HOME
  export HOME=/var/www

In Red Hat/CentOS, modify the ``/etc/sysconfig/httpd`` file and add the 
following line to set the HOME variable in Apache::

  export HOME=/usr/share/httpd
 
By default CentOS has activated SELinux, and the ``httpd`` process can not make 
outgoing network connections. This will cause problems with the ``curl``, 
``ldap`` 
and ``samba`` libraries. You'll need to get around this in order to make 
this work. First check the status::

  getsebool -a | grep httpd
  httpd_can_network_connect --> off

Then enable support for network connections::

  setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1

In openSUSE, modify the ``/usr/sbin/start_apache2`` file::
 
  export HOME=/var/lib/apache2

Restart Apache, open your Nextcloud Admin page and start creating SMB/CIFS 
mounts.
