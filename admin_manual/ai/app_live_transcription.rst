App: Live Transcription in Nextcloud Talk (live_transcription)
==============================================================

.. _ai-live-transcription:

This app provides live transcription of speech in Nextcloud Talk calls using open source AI models provided by `Vosk <https://alphacephei.com/vosk/>`_.
The transcription is done on your own server, preserving your privacy and data sovereignty.

A good set of language models are auto-downloaded. They include Arabic, Arabic (Tunisian), Breton, Catalan, Czech, German, English, Esperanto, Spanish, Persian (Farsi), French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Kazakh, Korean, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Telegu, Tajik, Turkish, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Vietnamese and Chinese.

Installation
------------

1. Make sure the `Nextcloud Talk app <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/spreed>`_ is installed.
2. Make sure the High-Performance Backend is installed and configured in Nextcloud Talk settings. See the `Nextcloud Talk install manual <https://nextcloud-talk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-install/>`_ for more information.
3. Setup a :ref:`Deploy Demon <ai-app_api>` in AppAPI Admin settings.
4. Install the **live_transcription** app via the "Apps" page in Nextcloud, or by executing

.. code-block::

   occ app_api:app:register live_transcription \
     --env LT_HPB_URL=wss://cloud.example.com/standalone-signaling/spreed \
     --env LT_INTERNAL_SECRET=1234 \
     --wait-finish


.. note::

   Environment variables and mounts can be set during the app installation from the "Deploy Options" button.
   The models are stored in a persistent volume at ``/nc_app_live_transcription_data``.
   This volume is created automatically during the installation but you can also mount your own volume there.
   As the name suggests, this volume is persistent and will not be deleted when the app is updated or uninstalled
   (without removing data).


.. important::

   The environment variables ``LT_HPB_URL`` and ``LT_INTERNAL_SECRET`` must be set in the Deploy Options,
   and the High-Performance Backend must be functionally configured in Nextcloud Talk settings for the app to work.

* The languages other than English may have lower accuracy mainly due to the shipped models being smaller.
* The app currently does not support punctuation in the transcription.
