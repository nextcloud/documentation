==================================
App: Context Agent (context_agent)
==================================

.. _ai-app-context_agent:

The *context_agent* app is the app that provides AI agent functionality in Nextcloud and acts as a backend for the :ref:`Nextcloud Assistant app<ai-app-assistant>`. Nextcloud can provide customer support upon request, please talk to your account manager for the possibilities.

When the Context Agent app is installed the AI Chat in Nextcloud Assistant will be able to interact with your Nextcloud apps via virtual integrations that are called "tools". They allow the Assistant to perform actions in your Nextcloud upon sending instructions in a chat message.
Tool groups are only available if their requirements are met. They can be en- and disabled in the AI admin settings.

Requirements
------------

* This app is built as an External App and thus depends on AppAPI v3.1.0 or higher
* Nextcloud AIO is supported
* No GPU is necessary for Context Agent but one might be useful if you use it with a self-hosted provider like llm2

* CPU Sizing

   * At least 1GB of system RAM

Installation
------------

0. Make sure the :ref:`Nextcloud Assistant app<ai-app-assistant>` is installed
1. :ref:`Install AppAPI and setup a Deploy Demon<ai-app_api>`
2. Install the "Context Agent" ExApp via the "Apps" page in the Nextcloud web admin user interface
3. Install a text generation backend like :ref:`llm2 <ai-app-llm2>` or :ref:`integration_openai <ai-ai_as_a_service>` via the "Apps" page in Nextcloud


Model requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This app requires underlying Large language models to support tool calling. The default model in *llm2* does support tool calling since version 2.4.0.
Other models that may give good results are:

* Google Gemma 3 12B or higher
* Mistral 3 small 24B
* Qwen 2.5 8B or higher (May not work well with languages other than English)
* Watt Tool 8B or higher

See :ref:`llm2 documentation <ai-app-llm2>` on how to configure alternate models.

Scaling
-------

It is currently not possible to scale this app, we are working on this.

App store
---------

You can also find the app in our app store, where you can write a review: `<https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/context_agent>`_

Repository
----------

You can find the app's code repository on GitHub where you can report bugs and contribute fixes and features: `<https://github.com/nextcloud/context_agent>`_

Nextcloud customers should file bugs directly with our Support system.

Known Limitations
-----------------
* Make sure to test the language model you are using in concert with this app for whether they meet the use-case's quality requirements
* Most models have difficulties with languages other than English. Some sometimes answer in another language than used by the user. 
* Customer support is available upon request, however we can't solve false or problematic output, most performance issues, or other problems caused by the underlying model. 
  Support is thus limited only to bugs directly caused by the implementation of the app (connectors, API, front-end, AppAPI). We still try to optimize this as far as possible, so if you encounter any false or problematic output, you can report it `in a dedicated Github issue <https://github.com/nextcloud/context_agent/issues/51>`_ to help us improve this app.
