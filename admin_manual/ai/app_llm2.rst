======================================
App: Local large language model (llm2)
======================================

.. _ai-app-llm2:

The *llm2* app is one of the apps that provide text processing functionality using Large language models in Nextcloud and act as a text processing backend for the :ref:`Nextcloud Assistant app<ai-app-assistant>`, the *mail* app and :ref:`other apps making use of the core Translation API<tp-consumer-apps>`. The *llm2* app specifically runs only open source models and does so entirely on-premises. Nextcloud can provide customer support upon request, please talk to your account manager for the possibilities.

This app uses `ctransformers <https://github.com/marella/ctransformers>`_ under the hood and is thus compatible with any model in *gguf* format. Output quality will differ depending on which model you use, we recommend the following models:

* `Llama2 7b Chat <https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF>`_ (Slightly older; good quality; good acclaim)
* `NeuralBeagle14 7B <https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralBeagle14-7B-GGUF>`_ (Newer; good quality; less well known)

Requirements
------------

* This app is built as an External App and thus depends on AppAPI v2.3.0
* Nextcloud AIO is supported
* Using GPU is currently not supported

* CPU Sizing

   * The more cores you have and the more powerful the CPU the better, we recommend 10-20 cores
   * The app will hog all cores by default, so it is usually better to run it on a separate machine

Installation
------------

0. Make sure the :ref:`Nextcloud Assistant app<ai-app-assistant>` is installed
1. :ref:`Install AppAPI and setup a Deploy Demon<ai-app_api>`
2. Install the "Local large language model" ExApp via the "External Apps" page in the Nextcloud web admin user interface

Supplying alternate models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This app allows supplying alternate LLM models as *gguf* files in the ``/nc_app_llm2_data`` directory of the docker container.

1. Download a **gguf** model e.g. from huggingface
2. Copy the **gguf** file to ``/nc_app_llm2_data`` inside the docker container
3. Restart the llm2 ExApp
4. Select the new model in the Nextcloud AI admin settings

Scaling
-------

It is currently not possible to scale this app, we are working on this. Based on our calculations an instance has a rough capacity of 1000 user requests per hour. However, this number is based on theory and we do appreciate real-world feedback on this.

App store
---------

You can also find the app in our app store, where you can write a review: `<https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/llm2>`_

Repository
----------

You can find the app's code repository on GitHub where you can report bugs and contribute fixes and features: `<https://github.com/nextcloud/llm2>`_

Nextcloud customers should file bugs directly with our Support system.

Known Limitations
-----------------

* We currently only support the English language
* Language models are likely to generate false information and should thus only be used in situations that are not critical. It's recommended to only use AI at the beginning of a creation process and not at the end, so that outputs of AI serve as a draft for example and not as final product. Always check the output of language models before using it.
* Make sure to test the language model you are using it for whether it meets the use-case's quality requirements
* Language models notoriously have a high energy consumption, if you want to reduce load on your server you can choose smaller models or quantized models in excahnge for lower accuracy
* Customer support is available upon request, however we can't solve false or problematic output, most performance issues, or other problems caused by the underlying model. Support is thus limited only to bugs directly caused by the implementation of the app (connectors, API, front-end, AppAPI)
* Due to technical limitations that we are in the process of mitigating, each task currently incurs a time cost of between 0 and 5 minutes in addition to the actual processing time
