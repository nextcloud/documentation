=================
App: Context Chat
=================

.. _ai-app-context_chat:

Context Chat is an :ref:`assistant<ai-app-assistant>` feature that is implemented via an ensemble of two apps:

 * the *context_chat* app, written purely in PHP
 * the *context_chat_backend* ExternalApp written in Python

Together they provide the ContextChat *text processing* and *search* tasks accessible via the :ref:`Nextcloud Assistant app<ai-app-assistant>`.

The *context_chat* and *context_chat_backend* apps will use the Free text-to-text task processing providers like OpenAI integration, LLM2, etc. and such a provider is required on a fresh install, or it can be configured to run open source models entirely on-premises. Nextcloud can provide customer support upon request, please talk to your account manager for the possibilities.

This app supports input and output in the same languages that the currently configured Free text-to-text task processing provider supports.

Requirements
------------

* Minimal Nextcloud version: 30
* Nextcloud AIO is supported
* We currently support NVIDIA GPUs and x86_64 CPUs
* CPU that supports AVX and AVX2 instruction
* CUDA >= v12.2 on your host system
* GPU Setup Sizing

   * A NVIDIA GPU with at least 2GB VRAM
      * The requirements for the Free text-to-text providers should be checked separately
      * llm2's requirements can be found :ref:`here <ai-app-llm2>`
      * integration_openai does not have any additional GPU requirements
   * At least 8GB of system RAM
      * 2 GB + additional 500MB for each concurrent request made to the backend if configuration parameters are changed

* CPU Setup Sizing

   * At least 12GB of system RAM
      * 2 GB + additional 500MB for each request made to the backend if the Free text-to-text provider is not on the same machine
      * 8 GB is recommended in the above case for the default settings
   * This app makes use of the configured free text-to-text task processing provider instead of running its own language model by default, you will thus need 4+ cores for the embedding model only

* A dedicated machine is recommended

Space usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

This app employs a bundled DB with Vector support called `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_. All the users' textual data is duplicated, chunked and stored on disk in this vector DB along with semantic embedding vectors for the content.

Installation
------------

1. Make sure the :ref:`Nextcloud Assistant app<ai-app-assistant>` is installed
2. Setup a :ref:`Deploy Demon <ai-app_api>` in AppAPI Admin settings
3. Install the *context_chat_backend* ExApp via the "Apps" page in Nextcloud, or by executing (checkout the readme at https://github.com/nextcloud/context_chat_backend for manual install steps)

.. code-block::

   occ app_api:app:register context_chat_backend

4. Install the *context_chat* app via the "Apps" page in Nextcloud, or by executing

.. code-block::

   occ app:enable context_chat

5. Install a text generation backend like :ref:`llm2 <ai-app-llm2>` or `integration_openai <https://github.com/nextcloud/integration_openai>`_ via the "Apps" page in Nextcloud

6. Optionally but recommended, setup background workers for faster pickup of tasks. See :ref:`the relevant section in AI Overview<ai-overview_improve-ai-task-pickup-speed>` for more information.

**Note**: Both apps need to be installed and both major version and minor version of the two apps must match for the functionality to work (ie. "v1.3.4" and "v1.3.1"; but not "v1.3.4" and "v2.1.6"; and not "v1.3.4" and "v1.4.5"). Keep this in mind when updating.


Initial loading of data
-----------------------

Auto-indexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Context chat will automatically load user data into the Vector DB using asynchronous background jobs.
| The initial loading of data can take a long time depending on the number of files and their size.

The indexing jobs are set up to run during the Nextcloud instance's maintenance window (typically during the night) only. If you have not set a maintenance window, indexing will run 24/7.

You can set up a background job worker explicitly for Context Chat to avoid slowing down normal background job operation on larger instances.

.. code-block::

   php cron.php "OCA\\ContextChat\\BackgroundJobs\\IndexerJob" "OCA\\ContextChat\\BackgroundJobs\\ActionJob" "OCA\\ContextChat\\BackgroundJobs\\SubmitContentJob" "OCA\\ContextChat\\BackgroundJobs\\StorageCrawlJob" "OCA\\ContextChat\\BackgroundJobs\\InitialContentImportJob"

You can set this command to run every 15 minutes on weekends using cron for example.

Synchronous indexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| To index all the files synchronously, use the following command:
| Note: This does not interact with the auto-indexing feature and that list would remain unchanged. However, the indexed files would be skipped when the auto indexer runs.

.. code-block::

   occ context_chat:scan <user_id>

**Note**: The synchronous command could take several days to complete. On larger systems we thus recommend to use auto-indexing.

Scaling
-------

It is currently not possible to scale ExApps like Context Chat, we are working on this. Based on our calculations an instance has a rough capacity of 1000 user requests per hour. However, this number is based on theory and we do appreciate real-world feedback on this.

App store
---------

You can also find the *context_chat* app in our app store, where you can write a review: `<https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/context_chat>`_

Repository
----------

You can find the app's code repository on GitHub where you can report bugs and contribute fixes and features: `<https://github.com/nextcloud/context_chat>`_ and `<https://github.com/nextcloud/context_chat_backend>`_

Nextcloud customers should file bugs directly with our Customer Support.

Commands (OCC)
--------------

The options for each command can be found like this, using scan as example: ``context_chat:scan --help``

* ``context_chat:prompt``
   Ask a question about your data, with options for selective context.

* ``context_chat:search``
   Perform a semantic (vector DB based) search on your indexed documents, with options for selective context.

* ``context_chat:scan``
   Scan and index the user's documents based on the user ID provided, synchronously.

* ``context_chat:stats``
   | Shows the time taken to complete the initial indexing of the documents if it has finished,
   | and the current no. of items in the indexer and actions queue.
   | "Actions" refers to tasks like file deletions, ownership changes through share changes, etc.
   | These file and ownership changes are synced with the backed through this actions queue.


Configuration Options
---------------------

* ``auto_indexing`` boolean (default: true)
   To allow/disallow the IndexerJob from running in the background

.. code-block::

   occ config:app:set context_chat auto_indexing --value=true --type=boolean


Logs
----

Logs for both the ``context_chat`` PHP app and the ``context_chat_backend`` ExApp can be found in the admin settings of your Nextcloud GUI as well as in the Context Chat log file, which is usually located in the Nextcloud data directory. The log file is named ``context_chat.log``.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. If the docker container seems to suddenly restart during indexing or querying, it could be related to RAM/storage filling up, or AVX being unavailable on the system. AVX can be checked using ``grep -i avx /proc/cpuinfo`` command on the host system. If AVX is not available, the app will not work.
2. Look for issues in the diagnostic logs, the server logs and the docker container ``nc_app_context_chat_container`` logs. If unsure, open an issue in either of the repositories.
3. Check "Admin settings -> Context Chat" for statistics and information about the indexing process.

File access control rules not supported
---------------------------------------

In Nextcloud you can set up file access control rules using the [files_accesscontrol](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_accesscontrol) app to restrict access to certain files.

| Context Chat does **not** follow these rules

It is thus possible for users who have been denied access to a document via the files_accesscontrol app to still gain access via Context Chat
if the document is visible in the files app for the user in question.

Known Limitations
-----------------

* Language models are likely to generate false information and should thus only be used in situations that are not critical. It's recommended to only use AI at the beginning of a creation process and not at the end, so that outputs of AI serve as a draft for example and not as final product. Always check the output of language models before using it and make sure whether it meets your use-case's quality requirements.
* Customer support is available upon request, however we can't solve false or problematic output, most performance issues, or other problems caused by the underlying model. Support is thus limited only to bugs directly caused by the implementation of the app (connectors, API, front-end, AppAPI).
* Files larger than 100MB are not supported
* Password protected PDFs or any other files are not supported. There will be error logs mentioning cryptography and AES in the docker container when such files are encountered but it is nothing to worry about, they will be simply ignored and the system will continue to function normally.
