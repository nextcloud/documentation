Artificial Intelligence
=======================

We strive to bring Artificial Intelligence features to Nextcloud. This section highlights these features, how they work and where to find them.
All of these features are completely optional and need to be installed via separate Nextcloud Apps.

Ethical AI Rating
-----------------

Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features without relying on proprietary blobs or third party services. Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users with these cutting-edge technologies â€“ but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for more private, professional or sensitive data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating.

The rating has four levels:
 * Red
 * Orange
 * Yellow
 * Green

It is based on points from these factors:
 * Is the software (both for inferencing and training) under a free and open source license?
 * Is the trained model freely available for self-hosting?
 * Is the training data available and free to use?

If all of these points are met, we give a Green label. If none are met, it is Red. If 1 condition is met, it is Orange and if 2 conditions are met, Yellow.


Features used by other apps
---------------------------

Some of our AI features are realized as generic APIs that any app can use and any app can provide an implementation for by registering a provider. So far, these are
Machine translation, Speech-To-Text and Text processing.

Machine translation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you can see in the table above we have multiple apps offering machine translation capabilities. Each app brings its own set of supported languages.
In downstream apps like the Text app, users can use the translation functionality regardless of which app implements it behind the scenes.

Implementing apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* *Text* for offering the translation menu
* `Analytics <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/analytics>`_ for translating graph labels

Speech-To-Text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you can see in the table above we have multiple apps offering Speech-To-Text capabilities. In downstream apps like the Talk app, users can use the transcription functionality regardless of which app implements it behind the scenes.

Implementing apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Speech-to-Text Helper <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/stt_helper>`_ for providing a Speech-To-Text smart picker
* `Talk <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/spreed>`_ for transcribing calls (see `Nextcloud Talk docs <https://nextcloud-talk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings/#app-configuration>`_ for how to enable this)

Text processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you can see in the table above we have multiple apps offering Text processing capabilities. In downstream apps like the Nextcloud Assistant app, users can use the text processing functionality regardless of which app implements it behind the scenes.

Implementing apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Assistant <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/assistant>`_ for various tasks
* `Mail <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/mail>`_ for summarizing mail threads (see :ref:`the Nextcloud Mail docs<mail_thread_summary>` for how to enable this)
* `SummarAI <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/summarai>`_ for summarizing chat histories in `Talk <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/spreed>`_

Image generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you can see in the table above we have multiple apps offering Image generation capabilities. In downstream apps like the Text-to-Image helper app, users can use the image generation functionality regardless of which app implements it behind the scenes.

Implementing apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Text-to-Image Helper <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/stt_helper>`_ for providing a Text-to-Image smart picker

Context Chat (Tech preview)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our Context Chat feature was introduced in Nextcloud Hub 7 (v28). It allows asking questions to the assistant related to your documents in Nextcloud. You will need to install both the context_chat app as well as the context_chat_backend External App. Be prepared that things might break or be a little rough around the edges. We look forward to your feedback!

Implementing apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Assistant <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/assistant>`_ for the context chat task
