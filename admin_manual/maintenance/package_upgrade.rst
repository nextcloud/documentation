Upgrade Nextcloud From Packages
==============================

.. note:: Starting with Nextcloud 8.2 the Linux package repositories have 
   changed, and **you must configure your system to use these new 
   repositories** to install or upgrade Nextcloud 8.2+. The new repositories are 
   at our `Open Build Service`_.
   
Upgrade Quickstart
------------------

The best method for keeping Nextcloud current on Linux servers is by configuring 
your system to use Nextcloud's `Open Build Service`_ repository. Then stay 
current by using your Linux package manager to install fresh Nextcloud packages. 
After installing upgraded packages you must run a few more steps to complete 
the 
upgrade. These are the basic steps to upgrading Nextcloud:

* :doc:`Disable <../installation/apps_management_installation>` all third-party 
  apps.
* Make a :doc:`fresh backup <backup>`.
* Upgrade your Nextcloud packages.
* Run :ref:`occ upgrade <command_line_upgrade_label>` (optionally disabling the 
  :ref:`migration test   
  <migration_test_label>`).
* :ref:`Apply strong permissions <strong_perms_label>` to your 
  Nextcloud directories.
* Take your Nextcloud server out of :ref:`maintenance mode 
  <maintenance_commands_label>`.  
* Re-enable third-party apps.

Upgrade Tips
------------

Upgrading Nextcloud from our `Open Build Service`_ repository is just like any 
normal Linux upgrade. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu Linux this is the 
standard system upgrade command::

 apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
 
Or you can upgrade just Nextcloud with this command::

 apt-get update && apt-get install nextcloud
 
On Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux use ``yum`` to see all available updates::

 yum check-update
 
You can apply all available updates with this command::
 
 yum update
 
Or update only Nextcloud::
 
 yum update nextcloud
 
Your Linux package manager only downloads the current Nextcloud packages. Then 
your Nextcloud server is immediately put into maintenance mode. You may not see 
this until you refresh your Nextcloud page.

Then use ``occ`` to complete the upgrade. You must run ``occ`` as your HTTP 
user. This example is for Debian/Ubuntu::

 sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade

This example is for CentOS/RHEL/Fedora::

 sudo -u apache php occ upgrade 

.. _migration_test_label:

Migration Test
--------------

Before completing the upgrade, Nextcloud first runs a simulation by copying all 
database tables to new tables, and then performs the upgrade on them, to ensure 
that the upgrade will complete correctly. The copied tables are deleted after 
the upgrade. This takes twice as much time, which on large installations can be 
many hours, so you can omit this step with the ``--skip-migration-test`` 
option, like this example on CentOS::

 $ sudo -u apache php occ upgrade --skip-migration-test

Setting Strong Directory Permissions
------------------------------------

After upgrading, verify that your Nextcloud directory permissions are set 
according to :ref:`strong_perms_label`.

If the upgrade fails, then you must try a manual upgrade.

Upgrading Across Skipped Releases
---------------------------------

It is best to update your Nextcloud installation with every new point release, 
and to never skip any major releases. If you have skipped any major releases you 
can bring your Nextcloud current with these steps:

#. Add the repository of your current version
#. Upgrade your current version to the latest point release
#. Add the repo of the next major release
#. Upgrade your current version to the next major release
#. Run upgrade routine
#. Repeat from step 3 until you reach the last available major release

You'll find previous Nextcloud releases in the `Nextcloud Server Changelog 
<https://nextcloud.org/changelog/>`_.

If upgrading via your package manager fails, then you must perform a 
:doc:`manual_upgrade`.
