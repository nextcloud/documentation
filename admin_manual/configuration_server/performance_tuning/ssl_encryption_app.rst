SSL / Encryption App
====================

SSL (HTTPS) and file encryption/decryption can be offloaded to a processor's 
AES-NI extension. This can both speed up these operations while lowering 
processing overhead. This requires a processor with the `AES-NI instruction set 
<http://wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set>`_.

Here are some examples how to check if your CPU / environment supports the 
AES-NI extension:

* For each CPU core present: ``grep flags /proc/cpuinfo`` or as a summary for 
  all cores: ``grep -m 1 ^flags /proc/cpuinfo`` If the result contains any 
  ``aes``, the extension is present.   

.. windows is not supported on 8.x  
.. * On Windows you can run ``coreinfo`` from Sysinternals `Windows 
.. Sysinternals 
..  Download Coreinfo 
..  <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc835722.aspx>`_ which 
..  gives you details of the processor and extensions present. Note: you may 
.. have 
..  to run the command shell as administrator to get an output.
  
* Search eg. on the Intel web if the processor used supports the extension 
  `Intel Processor Feature Filter 
  <http://ark.intel.com/MySearch.aspx?AESTech=true>`_ You may set a filter by 
  ``"AES New Instructions"`` to get a reduced result set.
   
* For versions of openssl >= 1.0.1, AES-NI does not work via an engine and 
  will not show up in the ``openssl engine`` command. It is active by default 
  on the supported hardware. You can check the openssl version via ``openssl 
  version -a``
    
* If your processor supports AES-NI but it does not show up eg via grep or 
  coreinfo, it is maybe disabled in the BIOS.
  
* If your environment runs virtualized, check the virtualization vendor for 
  support.
