Brute force protection
======================

Introduction
------------

Nextcloud has built-in protection against brute force attempts. 

The brute force protection feature is meant to protect Nextcloud servers from attempts to guess 
passwords and tokens in various ways. Besides the obvious "let's try a big list of commonly used 
passwords" attack, it also makes it harder to use slightly more sophisticated attacks via the reset 
password page or trying to find app password tokens. It is used throughout the Nextcloud ecosystem, 
including by other apps, if they have sensitive entrypoints (and choose to enable support for it).

How it works
------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

If triggered, brute force protection makes requests - coming from an IP address via a brute 
force protected entrypoint - slower for up to a 24 hour period. In extreme circumstances it may prevent
access outright, for up to 30 minutes, from a problematic IP address.

This protects your system from attackers trying, for example, a lot of different passwords.

The primary filter is IP address-based. This means that any account - even one associated with
a given brute force attempt - is not impacted when it is connecting from a different IP address
than any brute force attempts. This helps minimize inadvertent denial of service attacks against 
legitimate connections, while maximizing attack resistance from problematic IP sources.

Nuisance triggers are minimized through reasonable built-in defaults appropriate to each type of action.

The attempts history is automatically managed by a daily cronjob. Individual entries
expire after 48 hours (attempts, however, may be still *logged* indefinitely elsewhere through the usual 
mechanisms within Nextcloud Server and at the discretion of the admin).

Excluding (whitelisting) select IP addresses from brute force protection to prevent false 
positives is supported, but usually false positives are best handled by fixing the underlying causes 
(e.g. a misconfigured reverse proxy or misbehaving client). 

.. tip:: If you do notice a problem with the authentication behavior of any the official Nextcloud clients, 
  please report it to the appropriate repository so that it can be looked into.

Keeping brute force protection active and operating properly helps protects your Nextcloud Server from 
malicious actors while minimizing potential impact on legitimate usage.

Example: The login page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The brute force protection is easiest to see in action on the login page.
If you try to log in the first time with an invalid username and/or password you
will not notice anything. But if you do this a few times you start to notice
that the verification of the login is taking longer each time. This is the
brute force protection kicking in.

The maximum delay is 25 seconds, unless maximum number of attempts (currently 10) was reached within 
the last 30 minutes (in which case a ``429 Too Many Requests`` will be returned until the maximum attempts 
within the recent time has dropped below the threshold).

After a successful login (from the same source IP address), any prior invalid login attempts will be cleared 
and you will no longer be hit by the delay.

.. note:: Not all actions are necessarily viewed the same. It is possible for some activities to be more (or less) strict
   than others.

Usage
-----

Activating
~~~~~~~~~~

Brute force protection is enabled by default on Nextcloud. Its behavior can be adjusted through the 
``bruteforcesettings`` app (shipped with Server and enabled by default), several ``occ`` commands, and several 
``config.php`` parameters. Its effectiveness is highly dependent on having a properly configured environment, 
particularly when integrating a reverse proxy with Nextcloud (and associated parameters such as ``trusted_proxies``).

The brute force settings app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This app, which shipped and enabled by default, makes it possible (via the Web UI) to view the status of a 
connection and modify certain parameters of the brute force protection built into Nextcloud Server.

The user interface added by this app is found under *Administration settings -> Security* under the *Brute-force 
IP whitelist* heading.

Currently an admin can view the status of the IP address they are connecting from as well as specify IPv4 or IPv6 
addresses and ranges to exempt from brute force protection.

Additional enhancements may be made in the future, within this app and/or in combination with Nextcloud Server for 
additional monitoring or behavior adjustments related to brute force protection.

.. warning:: Disabling the ``bruteforcesettings`` app does **not** disable brute force protection 
   - it merely removes your ability to adjust brute force related settings from the Web interface.
   
.. danger::

   You would need to adjust the parameter ``auth.bruteforce.protection.enabled`` in your Nextcloud ``config.php`` to 
   disable brute force protection, which is **heavily discouraged for production servers**, particularly if your 
   server is reachable via a public IP address. It allows an attacker to iterate over all users and their passwords 
   as well as two-factor verifications afterwards ultimately leading to admin access.

``occ`` commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several brute force related ``occ`` commands under ``occ security``.

Brute force protection and load balancers/reverse proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are behind a reverse proxy or load balancer it is important you make sure it is
setup properly. Especially the **trusted_proxies** and **forwarded_for_headers**
`config.php` variables need to be set correctly. Otherwise it can happen
that Nextcloud actually starts throttling all traffic coming from the reverse
proxy or load balancer. For more information see :doc:`reverse_proxy_configuration`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

On most setups Nextcloud will work out of the box without any issues. If you
run into a situation where logging in or connecting is often very slow for multiple users, the first
step is to check your Nextcloud Server logs to see what IP addresses are being detected (you may need 
adjust your logging to INFO level temporarily to do so). 

If all clients appear to be coming from the same IP address and that IP address happens to be your 
proxy, you need to review your ``trusted_proxies`` configuration. If it is a common connection point,
such as a multi-user office location, it is possible whitelisting is appropriate.

For testing purposes you want want to whitelist your own IP address to see if the problem disappears.
If it does - and assuming your proxy configuration is correct - you may have a client/device in your
network that is misbehaving and generating invalid login attempts from your IP address.

For detailed troubleshooting, you may wish to inspect the `bruteforce_attempts` database table. There 
you can see which IP addresses are throttled and any other metadata stored about their attempts to 
connect.

Excluding IP addresses from brute force protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Most nuisance triggering of brute force protection can be resolved through proper configuration of reverse 
   proxies. In other cases, select IP addresses that need to be whitelisted can be configured within this app (while 
   leaving brute force protection enabled). This can be useful for testing purposes or when there are a lot of people 
   (or devices) connecting from a known, single IP address.

It's possible to exclude IP addresses from the brute force protection.

- Make sure the ``bruteforcesettings`` app is enabled (it is by default)
- Login as admin and go to **Administration settings -> Security**

.. danger::

   Any excluded IP address can perform authentication attempts without any throttling.
   It's best to exclude as few IP addresses as you can, or even none at all.
