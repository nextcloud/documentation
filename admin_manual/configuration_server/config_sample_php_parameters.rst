========================
Configuration Parameters
========================

Nextcloud uses the ``config/config.php`` file to control server operations.
``config/config.sample.php`` lists all the configurable parameters within
Nextcloud, along with example or default values. This document provides a more
detailed reference. Most options are configurable on your Admin page, so it
is usually not necessary to edit ``config/config.php``.

.. note:: The installer creates a configuration containing the essential parameters.
   Only manually add configuration parameters to ``config/config.php`` if you need to
   use a special value for a parameter. **Do not copy everything from**
   ``config/config.sample.php`` **. Only enter the parameters you wish to modify!**

Multiple config.php file
------------------------

Nextcloud supports loading configuration parameters from multiple files.
You can add arbitrary files ending with :file:`.config.php` in the :file:`config/`
directory, for example you could place your email server configuration
in :file:`email.config.php`. This allows you to easily create and manage
custom configurations, or to divide a large complex configuration file
into a set of smaller files. These custom files are not overwritten by
Nextcloud, and the values in these files take precedence over :file:`config.php`.

Default Parameters
------------------

These parameters are configured by the Nextcloud installer, and are required
for your Nextcloud server to operate.


::

	'instanceid' => '',

This is a unique identifier for your Nextcloud installation, created
automatically by the installer. This example is for documentation only,
and you should never use it because it will not work. A valid ``instanceid``
is created when you install Nextcloud.

'instanceid' => 'd3c944a9a',

::

	'passwordsalt' => '',

The salt used to hash all passwords, auto-generated by the Nextcloud
installer. (There are also per-user salts.) If you lose this salt you lose
all your passwords. This example is for documentation only, and you should
never use it.

::

	'trusted_domains' =>
	  array (
	    'demo.example.org',
	    'otherdomain.example.org',
	  ),

Your list of trusted domains that users can log into. Specifying trusted
domains prevents host header poisoning. Do not remove this, as it performs
necessary security checks.

You can specify:

- the exact hostname of your host or virtual host, e.g. demo.example.org.
- the exact hostname with permitted port, e.g. demo.example.org:443.
  This disallows all other ports on this host
- use * as a wildcard, e.g. ubos-raspberry-pi*.local will allow
  ubos-raspberry-pi.local and ubos-raspberry-pi-2.local

::

	'datadirectory' => '/var/www/nextcloud/data',

Where user files are stored. The SQLite database is also stored here, when
you use SQLite.

Default to ``data/`` in the Nextcloud directory.

::

	'version' => '',

The current version number of your Nextcloud installation. This is set up
during installation and update, so you shouldn't need to change it.

::

	'dbtype' => 'sqlite3',

Identifies the database used with this installation. See also config option
``supportedDatabases``

Available:
	- sqlite3 (SQLite3)
	- mysql (MySQL/MariaDB)
	- pgsql (PostgreSQL)

Defaults to ``sqlite3``

::

	'dbhost' => '',

Your host server name, for example ``localhost``, ``hostname``,
``hostname.example.com``, or the IP address. To specify a port use
``hostname:####``; to specify a Unix socket use
``localhost:/path/to/socket``.

::

	'dbname' => 'nextcloud',

The name of the Nextcloud database, which is set during installation. You
should not need to change this.

::

	'dbuser' => '',

The user that Nextcloud uses to write to the database. This must be unique
across Nextcloud instances using the same SQL database. This is set up during
installation, so you shouldn't need to change it.

::

	'dbpassword' => '',

The password for the database user. This is set up during installation, so
you shouldn't need to change it.

::

	'dbtableprefix' => '',

Prefix for the Nextcloud tables in the database.

Default to ``oc_``

::

	'installed' => false,

Indicates whether the Nextcloud instance was installed successfully; ``true``
indicates a successful installation, and ``false`` indicates an unsuccessful
installation.

Defaults to ``false``

.. DEFAULT_SECTION_END
.. Generated content above. Don't change this.

Default config.php Examples
---------------------------
When you use SQLite as your Nextcloud database, your ``config.php`` looks like
this after installation. The SQLite database is stored in your Nextcloud
``data/`` directory. SQLite is a simple, lightweight embedded database that
is good for testing and for simple installations, but for production Nextcloud
systems you should use MySQL, MariaDB, or PosgreSQL.

::

  <?php
  $CONFIG = array (
    'instanceid' => 'occ6f7365735',
    'passwordsalt' => '2c5778476346786306303',
    'trusted_domains' =>
    array (
      0 => 'localhost',
      1 => 'studio',
    ),
    'datadirectory' => '/var/www/nextcloud/data',
    'dbtype' => 'sqlite3',
    'version' => '7.0.2.1',
    'installed' => true,
  );

This example is from a new Nextcloud installation using MariaDB::


  <?php
  $CONFIG = array (
    'instanceid' => 'oc8c0fd71e03',
    'passwordsalt' => '515a13302a6b3950a9d0fdb970191a',
    'trusted_domains' =>
    array (
      0 => 'localhost',
      1 => 'studio',
      2 => '192.168.10.155'
    ),
    'datadirectory' => '/var/www/nextcloud/data',
    'dbtype' => 'mysql',
     'version' => '7.0.2.1',
    'dbname' => 'nextcloud',
    'dbhost' => 'localhost',
    'dbtableprefix' => 'oc_',
    'dbuser' => 'oc_carla',
    'dbpassword' => '67336bcdf7630dd80b2b81a413d07',
    'installed' => true,
  );

User Experience
---------------

These optional parameters control some aspects of the user interface. Default
values, where present, are shown.


::

	'default_language' => 'en',

This sets the default language on your Nextcloud server, using ISO_639-1
language codes such as ``en`` for English, ``de`` for German, and ``fr`` for
French. It overrides automatic language detection on public pages like login
or shared items. User's language preferences configured under "personal ->
language" override this setting after they have logged in. Nextcloud has two
distinguished language codes for German, 'de' and 'de_DE'. 'de' is used for
informal German and 'de_DE' for formal German. By setting this value to 'de_DE'
you can enforce the formal version of German unless the user has chosen
something different explicitly.

Defaults to ``en``

::

	'force_language' => 'en',

With this setting a language can be forced for all users. If a language is
forced, the users are also unable to change their language in the personal
settings. If users shall be unable to change their language, but users have
different languages, this value can be set to ``true`` instead of a language
code.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'default_locale' => 'en_US',

This sets the default locale on your Nextcloud server, using ISO_639
language codes such as ``en`` for English, ``de`` for German, and ``fr`` for
French, and ISO-3166 country codes such as ``GB``, ``US``, ``CA``, as defined
in RFC 5646. It overrides automatic locale detection on public pages like
login or shared items. User's locale preferences configured under "personal
-> locale" override this setting after they have logged in.

Defaults to ``en``

::

	'force_locale' => 'en_US',

With this setting a locale can be forced for all users. If a locale is
forced, the users are also unable to change their locale in the personal
settings. If users shall be unable to change their locale, but users have
different languages, this value can be set to ``true`` instead of a locale
code.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'defaultapp' => 'files',

Set the default app to open on login. Use the app names as they appear in the
URL after clicking them in the Apps menu, such as documents, calendar, and
gallery. You can use a comma-separated list of app names, so if the first
app is not enabled for a user then Nextcloud will try the second one, and so
on. If no enabled apps are found it defaults to the Files app.

Defaults to ``files``

::

	'knowledgebaseenabled' => true,

``true`` enables the Help menu item in the user menu (top right of the
Nextcloud Web interface). ``false`` removes the Help item.

::

	'allow_user_to_change_display_name' => true,

``true`` allows users to change their display names (on their Personal
pages), and ``false`` prevents them from changing their display names.

::

	'remember_login_cookie_lifetime' => 60*60*24*15,

Lifetime of the remember login cookie. This should be larger than the
session_lifetime. If it is set to 0 remember me is disabled.

Defaults to ``60*60*24*15`` seconds (15 days)

::

	'session_lifetime' => 60 * 60 * 24,

The lifetime of a session after inactivity.

Defaults to ``60*60*24`` seconds (24 hours)

::

	'session_keepalive' => true,

Enable or disable session keep-alive when a user is logged in to the Web UI.

Enabling this sends a "heartbeat" to the server to keep it from timing out.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'token_auth_enforced' => false,

Enforce token authentication for clients, which blocks requests using the user
password for enhanced security. Users need to generate tokens in personal settings
which can be used as passwords on their clients.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'auth.bruteforce.protection.enabled' => true,

Whether the bruteforce protection shipped with Nextcloud should be enabled or not.

Disabling this is discouraged for security reasons.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'skeletondirectory' => '/path/to/nextcloud/core/skeleton',

The directory where the skeleton files are located. These files will be
copied to the data directory of new users. Leave empty to not copy any
skeleton files.

``{lang}`` can be used as a placeholder for the language of the user.
If the directory does not exist, it falls back to non dialect (from ``de_DE``
to ``de``). If that does not exist either, it falls back to ``default``

Defaults to ``core/skeleton`` in the Nextcloud directory.

::

	'lost_password_link' => 'https://example.org/link/to/password/reset',

If your user backend does not allow password resets (e.g. when it's a
read-only user backend like LDAP), you can specify a custom link, where the
user is redirected to, when clicking the "reset password" link after a failed
login-attempt.

In case you do not want to provide any link, replace the url with 'disabled'

Mail Parameters
---------------

These configure the email settings for Nextcloud notifications and password
resets.


::

	'mail_domain' => 'example.com',

The return address that you want to appear on emails sent by the Nextcloud
server, for example ``nc-admin@example.com``, substituting your own domain,
of course.

::

	'mail_from_address' => 'nextcloud',

FROM address that overrides the built-in ``sharing-noreply`` and
``lostpassword-noreply`` FROM addresses.

Defaults to different from addresses depending on the feature.

::

	'mail_smtpdebug' => false,

Enable SMTP class debugging.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'mail_smtpmode' => 'smtp',

Which mode to use for sending mail: ``sendmail``, ``smtp`` or ``qmail``.

If you are using local or remote SMTP, set this to ``smtp``.

For the ``sendmail`` option you need an installed and working email system on
the server, with ``/usr/sbin/sendmail`` installed on your Unix system.

For ``qmail`` the binary is /var/qmail/bin/sendmail, and it must be installed
on your Unix system.

Defaults to ``smtp``

::

	'mail_smtphost' => '127.0.0.1',

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Specify the IP address of your mail
server host. This may contain multiple hosts separated by a semi-colon. If
you need to specify the port number append it to the IP address separated by
a colon, like this: ``127.0.0.1:24``.

Defaults to ``127.0.0.1``

::

	'mail_smtpport' => 25,

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Specify the port for sending mail.

Defaults to ``25``

::

	'mail_smtptimeout' => 10,

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. This sets the SMTP server timeout, in
seconds. You may need to increase this if you are running an anti-malware or
spam scanner.

Defaults to ``10`` seconds

::

	'mail_smtpsecure' => '',

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Specify when you are using ``ssl`` or
``tls``, or leave empty for no encryption.

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'mail_smtpauth' => false,

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Change this to ``true`` if your mail
server requires authentication.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'mail_smtpauthtype' => 'LOGIN',

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. If SMTP authentication is required, choose
the authentication type as ``LOGIN`` or ``PLAIN``.

Defaults to ``LOGIN``

::

	'mail_smtpname' => '',

This depends on ``mail_smtpauth``. Specify the username for authenticating to
the SMTP server.

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'mail_smtppassword' => '',

This depends on ``mail_smtpauth``. Specify the password for authenticating to
the SMTP server.

Default to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'mail_template_class' => '\OC\Mail\EMailTemplate',

Replaces the default mail template layout. This can be utilized if the
options to modify the mail texts with the theming app is not enough.

The class must extend  ``\OC\Mail\EMailTemplate``

::

	'mail_send_plaintext_only' => false,

Email will be send by default with an HTML and a plain text body. This option
allows to only send plain text emails.

::

	'mail_smtpstreamoptions' => array(),

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Array of additional streams options that
will be passed to underlying Swift mailer implementation.

Defaults to an empty array.

::

	'mail_sendmailmode' => 'smtp',

Which mode is used for sendmail/qmail: ``smtp`` or ``pipe``.

For ``smtp`` the sendmail binary is started with the parameter ``-bs``:
  - Use the SMTP protocol on standard input and output.

For ``pipe`` the binary is started with the parameters ``-t``:
  - Read message from STDIN and extract recipients.

Defaults to ``smtp``

Proxy Configurations
--------------------


::

	'overwritehost' => '',

The automatic hostname detection of Nextcloud can fail in certain reverse
proxy and CLI/cron situations. This option allows you to manually override
the automatic detection; for example ``www.example.com``, or specify the port
``www.example.com:8080``.

::

	'overwriteprotocol' => '',

When generating URLs, Nextcloud attempts to detect whether the server is
accessed via ``https`` or ``http``. However, if Nextcloud is behind a proxy
and the proxy handles the ``https`` calls, Nextcloud would not know that
``ssl`` is in use, which would result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Valid values are ``http`` and ``https``.

::

	'overwritewebroot' => '',

Nextcloud attempts to detect the webroot for generating URLs automatically.

For example, if ``www.example.com/nextcloud`` is the URL pointing to the
Nextcloud instance, the webroot is ``/nextcloud``. When proxies are in use,
it may be difficult for Nextcloud to detect this parameter, resulting in
invalid URLs.

::

	'overwritecondaddr' => '',

This option allows you to define a manual override condition as a regular
expression for the remote IP address. For example, defining a range of IP
addresses starting with ``10.0.0.`` and ending with 1 to 3:
``^10\.0\.0\.[1-3]$``

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'overwrite.cli.url' => '',

Use this configuration parameter to specify the base URL for any URLs which
are generated within Nextcloud using any kind of command line tools (cron or
occ). The value should contain the full base URL:
``https://www.example.com/nextcloud``

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/',

To have clean URLs without `/index.php` this parameter needs to be configured.

This parameter will be written as "RewriteBase" on update and installation of
Nextcloud to your `.htaccess` file. While this value is often simply the URL
path of the Nextcloud installation it cannot be set automatically properly in
every scenario and needs thus some manual configuration.

In a standard Apache setup this usually equals the folder that Nextcloud is
accessible at. So if Nextcloud is accessible via "https://mycloud.org/nextcloud"
the correct value would most likely be "/nextcloud". If Nextcloud is running
under "https://mycloud.org/" then it would be "/".

Note that the above rule is not valid in every case, as there are some rare setup
cases where this may not apply. However, to avoid any update problems this
configuration value is explicitly opt-in.

After setting this value run `occ maintenance:update:htaccess`. Now, when the
following conditions are met Nextcloud URLs won't contain `index.php`:

- `mod_rewrite` is installed
- `mod_env` is installed

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'htaccess.IgnoreFrontController' => false,

For server setups, that don't have `mod_env` enabled or restricted (e.g. suEXEC)
this parameter has to be set to true and will assume mod_rewrite.

Please check, if `mod_rewrite` is active and functional before setting this
parameter and you updated your .htaccess with `occ maintenance:update:htaccess`.
Otherwise your nextcloud installation might not be reachable anymore.
For example, try accessing resources by leaving out `index.php` in the URL.

::

	'proxy' => '',

The URL of your proxy server, for example ``proxy.example.com:8081``.

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'proxyuserpwd' => '',

The optional authentication for the proxy to use to connect to the internet.

The format is: ``username:password``.

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

Deleted Items (trash bin)
-------------------------

These parameters control the Deleted files app.


::

	'trashbin_retention_obligation' => 'auto',

If the trash bin app is enabled (default), this setting defines the policy
for when files and folders in the trash bin will be permanently deleted.

The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for trash bin retention,
and a maximum time for trash bin retention.
Minimum time is the number of days a file will be kept, after which it
may be deleted. Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed
to be deleted.
Both minimum and maximum times can be set together to explicitly define
file and folder deletion. For migration purposes, this setting is installed
initially set to "auto", which is equivalent to the default setting in
Nextcloud.

Available values:

* ``auto``
    default setting. keeps files and folders in the trash bin for 30 days
    and automatically deletes anytime after that if space is needed (note:
    files may not be deleted if space is not needed).
* ``D, auto``
    keeps files and folders in the trash bin for D+ days, delete anytime if
    space needed (note: files may not be deleted if space is not needed)
* ``auto, D``
    delete all files in the trash bin that are older than D days
    automatically, delete other files anytime if space needed
* ``D1, D2``
    keep files and folders in the trash bin for at least D1 days and
    delete when exceeds D2 days
* ``disabled``
    trash bin auto clean disabled, files and folders will be kept forever

Defaults to ``auto``

File versions
-------------

These parameters control the Versions app.


::

	'versions_retention_obligation' => 'auto',

If the versions app is enabled (default), this setting defines the policy
for when versions will be permanently deleted.

The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for version retention,
and a maximum time for version retention.
Minimum time is the number of days a version will be kept, after which it
may be deleted. Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed
to be deleted.
Both minimum and maximum times can be set together to explicitly define
version deletion. For migration purposes, this setting is installed
initially set to "auto", which is equivalent to the default setting in
Nextcloud.

Available values:

* ``auto``
    default setting. Automatically expire versions according to expire
    rules. Please refer to :doc:`../configuration_files/file_versioning` for
    more information.
* ``D, auto``
    keep versions at least for D days, apply expire rules to all versions
    that are older than D days
* ``auto, D``
    delete all versions that are older than D days automatically, delete
    other versions according to expire rules
* ``D1, D2``
    keep versions for at least D1 days and delete when exceeds D2 days
* ``disabled``
    versions auto clean disabled, versions will be kept forever

Defaults to ``auto``

Nextcloud Verifications
-----------------------

Nextcloud performs several verification checks. There are two options,
``true`` and ``false``.


::

	'appcodechecker' => true,

Checks an app before install whether it uses private APIs instead of the
proper public APIs. If this is set to true it will only allow to install or
enable apps that pass this check.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'updatechecker' => true,

Check if Nextcloud is up-to-date and shows a notification if a new version is
available.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'updater.server.url' => 'https://updates.nextcloud.com/updater_server/',

URL that Nextcloud should use to look for updates

Defaults to ``https://updates.nextcloud.com/updater_server/``

::

	'updater.release.channel' => 'stable',

The channel that Nextcloud should use to look for updates

Supported values:
  - ``daily``
  - ``beta``
  - ``stable``

::

	'has_internet_connection' => true,

Is Nextcloud connected to the Internet or running in a closed network?

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'connectivity_check_domains' => array(
		'www.nextcloud.com',
		'www.startpage.com',
		'www.eff.org',
		'www.edri.org'
	),

Which domains to request to determine the availability of an Internet
connection. If none of these hosts are reachable, the administration panel
will show a warning. Set to an empty list to not do any such checks (warning
will still be shown).

Defaults to the following domains:

 - www.nextcloud.com
 - www.startpage.com
 - www.eff.org
 - www.edri.org

::

	'check_for_working_wellknown_setup' => true,

Allows Nextcloud to verify a working .well-known URL redirects. This is done
by attempting to make a request from JS to
https://your-domain.com/.well-known/caldav/

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'check_for_working_htaccess' => true,

This is a crucial security check on Apache servers that should always be set
to ``true``. This verifies that the ``.htaccess`` file is writable and works.

If it is not, then any options controlled by ``.htaccess``, such as large
file uploads, will not work. It also runs checks on the ``data/`` directory,
which verifies that it can't be accessed directly through the Web server.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'check_data_directory_permissions' => true,

In rare setups (e.g. on Openshift or docker on windows) the permissions check
might block the installation while the underlying system offers no means to
"correct" the permissions. In this case, set the value to false.

In regular cases, if issues with permissions are encountered they should be
adjusted accordingly. Changing the flag is discouraged.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'config_is_read_only' => false,

In certain environments it is desired to have a read-only configuration file.

When this switch is set to ``true`` Nextcloud will not verify whether the
configuration is writable. However, it will not be possible to configure
all options via the Web interface. Furthermore, when updating Nextcloud
it is required to make the configuration file writable again for the update
process.

Defaults to ``false``

Logging
-------


::

	'log_type' => 'file',

This parameter determines where the Nextcloud logs are sent.

``file``: the logs are written to file ``nextcloud.log`` in the default
Nextcloud data directory. The log file can be changed with parameter
``logfile``.
``syslog``: the logs are sent to the system log. This requires a syslog daemon
to be active.
``errorlog``: the logs are sent to the PHP ``error_log`` function.
``systemd``: the logs are sent to the Systemd journal. This requires a system
that runs Systemd and the Systemd journal. The PHP extension ``systemd``
must be installed and active.

Defaults to ``file``

::

	'logfile' => '/var/log/nextcloud.log',

Name of the file to which the Nextcloud logs are written if parameter
``log_type`` is set to ``file``.

Defaults to ``[datadirectory]/nextcloud.log``

::

	'logfilemode' => 0640,

Log file mode for the Nextcloud loggin type in octal notation.

Defaults to 0640 (writeable by user, readable by group).

::

	'loglevel' => 2,

Loglevel to start logging at. Valid values are: 0 = Debug, 1 = Info, 2 =
Warning, 3 = Error, and 4 = Fatal. The default value is Warning.

Defaults to ``2``

::

	'syslog_tag' => 'Nextcloud',

If you maintain different instances and aggregate the logs, you may want
to distinguish between them. ``syslog_tag`` can be set per instance
with a unique id. Only available if ``log_type`` is set to ``syslog`` or
``systemd``.

The default value is ``Nextcloud``.

::

	'log.condition' => [
		'shared_secret' => '57b58edb6637fe3059b3595cf9c41b9',
		'users' => ['sample-user'],
		'apps' => ['files'],
	],

Log condition for log level increase based on conditions. Once one of these
conditions is met, the required log level is set to debug. This allows to
debug specific requests, users or apps

Supported conditions:
 - ``shared_secret``: if a request parameter with the name `log_secret` is set to
               this value the condition is met
 - ``users``:  if the current request is done by one of the specified users,
               this condition is met
 - ``apps``:   if the log message is invoked by one of the specified apps,
               this condition is met

Defaults to an empty array.

::

	'logdateformat' => 'F d, Y H:i:s',

This uses PHP.date formatting; see http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

Defaults to ISO 8601 ``2005-08-15T15:52:01+00:00`` - see \DateTime::ATOM
(https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php#datetime.constants.atom)

::

	'logtimezone' => 'Europe/Berlin',

The timezone for logfiles. You may change this; see
http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

Defaults to ``UTC``

::

	'log_query' => false,

Append all database queries and parameters to the log file. Use this only for
debugging, as your logfile will become huge.

::

	'log_rotate_size' => 100 * 1024 * 1024,

Enables log rotation and limits the total size of logfiles. The default is 0,
or no rotation. Specify a size in bytes, for example 104857600 (100 megabytes
= 100 * 1024 * 1024 bytes). A new logfile is created with a new name when the
old logfile reaches your limit. If a rotated log file is already present, it
will be overwritten.

Defaults to 100 MB

Alternate Code Locations
------------------------

Some of the Nextcloud code may be stored in alternate locations.


::

	'customclient_desktop' =>
		'https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients',
	'customclient_android' =>

Apps
----

Options for the Apps folder, Apps store, and App code checker.


::

	'appstoreenabled' => true,

When enabled, admins may install apps from the Nextcloud app store.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'apps_paths' => array(
		array(
			'path'=> '/var/www/nextcloud/apps',
			'url' => '/apps',
			'writable' => true,
		),
	),

Use the ``apps_paths`` parameter to set the location of the Apps directory,
which should be scanned for available apps, and where user-specific apps
should be installed from the Apps store. The ``path`` defines the absolute
file system path to the app folder. The key ``url`` defines the HTTP Web path
to that folder, starting from the Nextcloud webroot. The key ``writable``
indicates if a Web server can write files to that folder.

::

	'appcodechecker' => true,

Checks an app before install whether it uses private APIs instead of the
proper public APIs. If this is set to true it will only allow to install or
enable apps that pass this check.

Defaults to ``false``





Previews
--------

Nextcloud supports previews of image files, the covers of MP3 files, and text
files. These options control enabling and disabling previews, and thumbnail
size.


::

	'enable_previews' => true,

By default, Nextcloud can generate previews for the following filetypes:

- Image files
- Covers of MP3 files
- Text documents

Valid values are ``true``, to enable previews, or
``false``, to disable previews

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'preview_max_x' => 4096,

The maximum height, in pixels, of a preview. A value of ``null`` means there
is no limit.

Defaults to ``4096``

::

	'preview_max_filesize_image' => 50,

max file size for generating image previews with imagegd (default behavior)
If the image is bigger, it'll try other preview generators, but will most
likely show the default mimetype icon. Set to -1 for no limit.

Defaults to ``50`` megabytes

::

	'preview_libreoffice_path' => '/usr/bin/libreoffice',

custom path for LibreOffice/OpenOffice binary

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

LDAP
----

Global settings used by LDAP User and Group Backend


::

	'ldapUserCleanupInterval' => 51,

defines the interval in minutes for the background job that checks user
existence and marks them as ready to be cleaned up. The number is always
minutes. Setting it to 0 disables the feature.

See command line (occ) methods ``ldap:show-remnants`` and ``user:delete``

Defaults to ``51`` minutes

::

Sort groups in the user settings by name instead of the user count

By enabling this the user count beside the group name is disabled as well.

Comments
--------

Global settings for the Comments infrastructure


::

	'comments.managerFactory' => '\OC\Comments\ManagerFactory',

Replaces the default Comments Manager Factory. This can be utilized if an
own or 3rdParty CommentsManager should be used that – for instance – uses the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the comments.

Defaults to ``\OC\Comments\ManagerFactory``

::

	'systemtags.managerFactory' => '\OC\SystemTag\ManagerFactory',

Replaces the default System Tags Manager Factory. This can be utilized if an
own or 3rdParty SystemTagsManager should be used that – for instance – uses the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the tags.

Defaults to ``\OC\SystemTag\ManagerFactory``

Maintenance
-----------

These options are for halting user activity when you are performing server
maintenance.


::

	'maintenance' => false,

Enable maintenance mode to disable Nextcloud

If you want to prevent users from logging in to Nextcloud before you start
doing some maintenance work, you need to set the value of the maintenance
parameter to true. Please keep in mind that users who are already logged-in
are kicked out of Nextcloud instantly.

Defaults to ``false``

SSL
---


::

	'openssl' => array(
		'config' => '/absolute/location/of/openssl.cnf',
	),

Extra SSL options to be used for configuration.

Defaults to an empty array.

Memory caching backend configuration
------------------------------------

Available cache backends:

* ``\OC\Memcache\APCu``       APC user backend
* ``\OC\Memcache\ArrayCache`` In-memory array-based backend (not recommended)
* ``\OC\Memcache\Memcached``  Memcached backend
* ``\OC\Memcache\Redis``      Redis backend

Advice on choosing between the various backends:

* APCu should be easiest to install. Almost all distributions have packages.
  Use this for single user environment for all caches.
* Use Redis or Memcached for distributed environments.
  For the local cache (you can configure two) take APCu.


::

	'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',

Memory caching backend for locally stored data

* Used for host-specific data, e.g. file paths

Defaults to ``none``

::

	'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Memcached',

Memory caching backend for distributed data

* Used for installation-specific data, e.g. database caching
* If unset, defaults to the value of memcache.local

Defaults to ``none``

::

	'redis' => [
		'host' => 'localhost', // can also be a unix domain socket: '/tmp/redis.sock'
		'port' => 6379,
		'timeout' => 0.0,
		'password' => '', // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
		'dbindex' => 0, // Optional, if undefined SELECT will not run and will use Redis Server's default DB Index.
	],

Connection details for redis to use for memory caching in a single server configuration.

For enhanced security it is recommended to configure Redis
to require a password. See http://redis.io/topics/security
for more information.

::

	'redis.cluster' => [
		'seeds' => [ // provide some/all of the cluster servers to bootstrap discovery, port required
			'localhost:7000',
			'localhost:7001',
		],
		'timeout' => 0.0,
		'read_timeout' => 0.0,
		'failover_mode' => \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_ERROR,
		'password' => '', // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
	],

Connection details for a Redis Cluster

Only for use with Redis Clustering, for Sentinel-based setups use the single
server configuration above, and perform HA on the hostname.

Redis Cluster support requires the php module phpredis in version 3.0.0 or
higher.

Available failover modes:
 - \\RedisCluster::FAILOVER_NONE - only send commands to master nodes (default)
 - \\RedisCluster::FAILOVER_ERROR - failover to slaves for read commands if master is unavailable (recommended)
 - \\RedisCluster::FAILOVER_DISTRIBUTE - randomly distribute read commands across master and slaves

WARNING: FAILOVER_DISTRIBUTE is a not recommended setting and we strongly
suggest to not use it if you use Redis for file locking. Due to the way Redis
is synchronized it could happen, that the read for an existing lock is
scheduled to a slave that is not fully synchronized with the connected master
which then causes a FileLocked exception.

See https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec for details about the Redis cluster

Authentication works with phpredis version 4.2.1+. See
https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis/commit/c5994f2a42b8a348af92d3acb4edff1328ad8ce1

::

	'memcached_servers' => array(
		// hostname, port and optional weight. Also see:
		// http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcached.addservers.php
		// http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcached.addserver.php
		array('localhost', 11211),
		//array('other.host.local', 11211),
	),

Server details for one or more memcached servers to use for memory caching.

::

	'memcached_options' => array(
		// Set timeouts to 50ms
		\Memcached::OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT => 50,
		\Memcached::OPT_RETRY_TIMEOUT =>   50,

	),

Connection options for memcached, see http://apprize.info/php/scaling/15.html

::

	'cache_path' => '',

Location of the cache folder, defaults to ``data/$user/cache`` where
``$user`` is the current user. When specified, the format will change to
``$cache_path/$user`` where ``$cache_path`` is the configured cache directory
and ``$user`` is the user.

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'cache_chunk_gc_ttl' => 60*60*24,

TTL of chunks located in the cache folder before they're removed by
garbage collection (in seconds). Increase this value if users have
issues uploading very large files via the Nextcloud Client as upload isn't
completed within one day.

Defaults to ``60*60*24`` (1 day)

Using Object Store with Nextcloud
---------------------------------


::

	'objectstore' => [
		'class' => 'OC\\Files\\ObjectStore\\Swift',
		'arguments' => [
			// trystack will use your facebook id as the user name
			'username' => 'facebook100000123456789',
			// in the trystack dashboard go to user -> settings -> API Password to
			// generate a password
			'password' => 'Secr3tPaSSWoRdt7',
			// must already exist in the objectstore, name can be different
			'container' => 'nextcloud',
			// prefix to prepend to the fileid, default is 'oid:urn:'
			'objectPrefix' => 'oid:urn:',
			// create the container if it does not exist. default is false
			'autocreate' => true,
			// required, dev-/trystack defaults to 'RegionOne'
			'region' => 'RegionOne',
			// The Identity / Keystone endpoint
			'url' => 'http://8.21.28.222:5000/v2.0',
			// required on dev-/trystack
			'tenantName' => 'facebook100000123456789',
			// dev-/trystack uses swift by default, the lib defaults to 'cloudFiles'
			// if omitted
			'serviceName' => 'swift',
			// The Interface / url Type, optional
			'urlType' => 'internal'
		],
	],

This example shows how to configure Nextcloud to store all files in a
swift object storage.

It is important to note that Nextcloud in object store mode will expect
exclusive access to the object store container because it only stores the
binary data for each file. The metadata is currently kept in the local
database for performance reasons.

WARNING: The current implementation is incompatible with any app that uses
direct file IO and circumvents our virtual filesystem. That includes
Encryption and Gallery. Gallery will store thumbnails directly in the
filesystem and encryption will cause severe overhead because key files need
to be fetched in addition to any requested file.

One way to test is applying for a trystack account at http://trystack.org/

::

	'objectstore' => [
		'class' => 'OC\\Files\\ObjectStore\\Swift',
		'arguments' => [
			'autocreate' => true,
			'user' => [
				'name' => 'swift',
				'password' => 'swift',
				'domain' => [
					'name' => 'default',
				],
			],
			'scope' => [
				'project' => [
					'name' => 'service',
					'domain' => [
						'name' => 'default',

		],
	],

Sharing
-------

Global settings for Sharing


::

	'sharing.managerFactory' => '\OC\Share20\ProviderFactory',

Replaces the default Share Provider Factory. This can be utilized if
own or 3rdParty Share Providers are used that – for instance – use the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the share information.

Defaults to ``\OC\Share20\ProviderFactory``

::

	'sharing.maxAutocompleteResults' => 0,

Define max number of results returned by the user search for auto-completion
Default is unlimited (value set to 0).

::

	'sharing.minSearchStringLength' => 0,

Define the minimum length of the search string before we start auto-completion
Default is no limit (value set to 0)

All other configuration options
-------------------------------


::

	'dbdriveroptions' => array(
		PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => '/file/path/to/ca_cert.pem',
		PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET wait_timeout = 28800'
	),

Additional driver options for the database connection, eg. to enable SSL
encryption in MySQL or specify a custom wait timeout on a cheap hoster.

::

	'sqlite.journal_mode' => 'DELETE',

sqlite3 journal mode can be specified using this configuration parameter -
can be 'WAL' or 'DELETE' see for more details https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html

::

	'mysql.utf8mb4' => false,

During setup, if requirements are met (see below), this setting is set to true
and MySQL can handle 4 byte characters instead of 3 byte characters.

If you want to convert an existing 3-byte setup into a 4-byte setup please
set the parameters in MySQL as mentioned below and run the migration command:
./occ db:convert-mysql-charset
The config setting will be set automatically after a successful run.

Consult the documentation for more details.

MySQL requires a special setup for longer indexes (> 767 bytes) which are
needed:

[mysqld]
innodb_large_prefix=ON
innodb_file_format=Barracuda
innodb_file_per_table=ON

Tables will be created with
 * character set: utf8mb4
 * collation:     utf8mb4_bin
 * row_format:    compressed

::

	'supportedDatabases' => array(
		'sqlite',
		'mysql',
		'pgsql',
		'oci',
	),

Database types that are supported for installation.

Available:
	- sqlite (SQLite3)
	- mysql (MySQL)
	- pgsql (PostgreSQL)
	- oci (Oracle)

Defaults to the following databases:
 - sqlite (SQLite3)
 - mysql (MySQL)
 - pgsql (PostgreSQL)

::

	'tempdirectory' => '/tmp/nextcloudtemp',

Override where Nextcloud stores temporary files. Useful in situations where
the system temporary directory is on a limited space ramdisk or is otherwise
restricted, or if external storages which do not support streaming are in
use.

The Web server user must have write access to this directory.

::

	'hashingCost' => 10,

The hashing cost used by hashes generated by Nextcloud
Using a higher value requires more time and CPU power to calculate the hashes

::

	'blacklisted_files' => array('.htaccess'),

Blacklist a specific file or files and disallow the upload of files
with this name. ``.htaccess`` is blocked by default.

WARNING: USE THIS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

Defaults to ``array('.htaccess')``

::

	'share_folder' => '/',

Define a default folder for shared files and folders other than root.

Changes to this value will only have effect on new shares.

Defaults to ``/``

::

	'theme' => '',

If you are applying a theme to Nextcloud, enter the name of the theme here.

The default location for themes is ``nextcloud/themes/``.

Defaults to the theming app which is shipped since Nextcloud 9

::

	'cipher' => 'AES-256-CFB',

The default cipher for encrypting files. Currently AES-128-CFB and
AES-256-CFB are supported.

::

	'minimum.supported.desktop.version' => '2.0.0',

The minimum Nextcloud desktop client version that will be allowed to sync with
this server instance. All connections made from earlier clients will be denied
by the server. Defaults to the minimum officially supported Nextcloud desktop
clientversion at the time of release of this server version.

When changing this, note that older unsupported versions of the Nextcloud desktop
client may not function as expected, and could lead to permanent data loss for
clients or other unexpected results.

Defaults to ``2.0.0``

::

	'quota_include_external_storage' => false,

EXPERIMENTAL: option whether to include external storage in quota
calculation, defaults to false.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'external_storage.auth_availability_delay' => 1800,

When an external storage is unavailable for some reasons, it will be flagged
as such for 10 minutes. When the trigger is a failed authentication attempt
the delay is higher and can be controlled with this option. The motivation
is to make account lock outs at Active Directories (and compatible) more
unlikely.

Defaults to ``1800`` (seconds)

::

	'filesystem_check_changes' => 0,

Specifies how often the local filesystem (the Nextcloud data/ directory, and
NFS mounts in data/) is checked for changes made outside Nextcloud. This
does not apply to external storages.

0 -> Never check the filesystem for outside changes, provides a performance
increase when it's certain that no changes are made directly to the
filesystem

1 -> Check each file or folder at most once per request, recommended for
general use if outside changes might happen.

Defaults to ``0``

::

	'part_file_in_storage' => true,

By default Nextcloud will store the part files created during upload in the
same storage as the upload target. Setting this to false will store the part
files in the root of the users folder which might be required to work with certain
external storage setups that have limited rename capabilities.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'mount_file' => '/var/www/nextcloud/data/mount.json',

Where ``mount.json`` file should be stored, defaults to ``data/mount.json``
in the Nextcloud directory.

Defaults to ``data/mount.json`` in the Nextcloud directory.

::

	'filesystem_cache_readonly' => false,

When ``true``, prevent Nextcloud from changing the cache due to changes in
the filesystem for all storage.

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'secret' => '',

Secret used by Nextcloud for various purposes, e.g. to encrypt data. If you
lose this string there will be data corruption.

::

	'trusted_proxies' => array('203.0.113.45', '198.51.100.128', '192.168.2.0/24'),

List of trusted proxy servers

You may set this to an array containing a combination of
- IPv4 addresses, e.g. `192.168.2.123`
- IPv4 ranges in CIDR notation, e.g. `192.168.2.0/24`
- IPv6 addresses, e.g. `fd9e:21a7:a92c:2323::1`

_(CIDR notation for IPv6 is currently work in progress and thus not
available as of yet)_

When an incoming request's `REMOTE_ADDR` matches any of the IP addresses
specified here, it is assumed to be a proxy instead of a client. Thus, the
client IP will be read from the HTTP header specified in
`forwarded_for_headers` instead of from `REMOTE_ADDR`.

So if you configure `trusted_proxies`, also consider setting
`forwarded_for_headers` which otherwise defaults to `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`
(the `X-Forwarded-For` header).

Defaults to an empty array.

::

	'forwarded_for_headers' => array('HTTP_X_FORWARDED', 'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR'),

Headers that should be trusted as client IP address in combination with
`trusted_proxies`. If the HTTP header looks like 'X-Forwarded-For', then use
'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' here.

If set incorrectly, a client can spoof their IP address as visible to
Nextcloud, bypassing access controls and making logs useless!

Defaults to ``'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'``

::

	'max_filesize_animated_gifs_public_sharing' => 10,

max file size for animating gifs on public-sharing-site.

If the gif is bigger, it'll show a static preview

Value represents the maximum filesize in megabytes. Set to ``-1`` for
no limit.

Defaults to ``10`` megabytes

::

	'filelocking.enabled' => true,

Enables transactional file locking.

This is enabled by default.

Prevents concurrent processes from accessing the same files
at the same time. Can help prevent side effects that would
be caused by concurrent operations. Mainly relevant for
very large installations with many users working with
shared files.

Defaults to ``true``

::

	'filelocking.ttl' => 60*60,

Set the lock's time-to-live in seconds.

Any lock older than this will be automatically cleaned up.

Defaults to ``60*60`` seconds (1 hour) or the php
            max_execution_time, whichever is higher.

::

	'memcache.locking' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\Redis',

Memory caching backend for file locking

Because most memcache backends can clean values without warning using redis
is highly recommended to *avoid data loss*.

Defaults to ``none``

::

	'filelocking.debug' => false,

Enable locking debug logging

Note that this can lead to a very large volume of log items being written which can lead
to performance degradation and large log files on busy instance.

Thus enabling this in production for longer periods of time is not recommended
or should be used together with the ``log.condition`` setting.

::

	'upgrade.disable-web' => false,

Disable the web based updater

::

	'debug' => false,

Set this Nextcloud instance to debugging mode

Only enable this for local development and not in production environments
This will disable the minifier and outputs some additional debug information

Defaults to ``false``

::

	'data-fingerprint' => '',

Sets the data-fingerprint of the current data served

This is a property used by the clients to find out if a backup has been
restored on the server. Once a backup is restored run
./occ maintenance:data-fingerprint
To set this to a new value.

Updating/Deleting this value can make connected clients stall until
the user has resolved conflicts.

Defaults to ``''`` (empty string)

::

	'copied_sample_config' => true,

This entry is just here to show a warning in case somebody copied the sample
configuration. DO NOT ADD THIS SWITCH TO YOUR CONFIGURATION!

If you, brave person, have read until here be aware that you should not
modify *ANY* settings in this file without reading the documentation.

::

	'lookup_server' => 'https://lookup.nextcloud.com',

use a custom lookup server to publish user data

::

	'gs.enabled' => false,

set to true if the server is used in a setup based on Nextcloud's Global Scale architecture

::

	'gs.federation' => 'internal',

by default federation is only used internally in a Global Scale setup
If you want to allow federation outside of your environment set it to 'global'

::

	'csrf.optout' => array(
		'/^WebDAVFS/', // OS X Finder
		'/^Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/', // Windows webdav drive
	),

List of incompatible user agents opted out from Same Site Cookie Protection.

Some user agents are notorious and don't really properly follow HTTP
specifications. For those, have an opt-out.

WARNING: only use this if you know what you are doing

::

	'simpleSignUpLink.shown' => true,

By default there is on public pages a link shown that allows users to
learn about the "simple sign up" - see https://nextcloud.com/signup/

If this is set to "false" it will not show the link.

::

	'login_form_autocomplete' => true,

By default autocompletion is enabled for the login form on Nextcloud's login page.

While this is enabled, browsers are allowed to "remember" login names and such.
Some companies require it to be disabled to comply with their security policy.

Simply set this property to "false", if you want to turn this feature off.
