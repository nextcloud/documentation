Config.php Parameters
=====================
ownCloud uses the ``config/config.php`` file to control server operations.
``config/config.sample.php`` lists all the configurable parameters within
ownCloud. This document provides a more detailed reference. Many options are
configurable on your Admin page, so it is usually not necessary to edit
``config/config.php``.

Default Parameters
------------------

These parameters are configured by the ownCloud installer, and are required
for your ownCloud server to operate.


::

	'instanceid' => '',

This is a unique identifier for your ownCloud installation, created
automatically by the installer. This example is for documentation only,
and you should never use it because it will not work. A valid ``instanceid``
is created when you install ownCloud.

'instanceid' => 'd3c944a9a',

::

	'passwordsalt' => '',

The salt used to hash all passwords, auto-generated by the ownCloud
installer. (There are also per-user salts.) If you lose this salt you lose
all your passwords. This example is for documentation only,
and you should never use it.

::

	'hashingCost' => 10,

The hashing cost used by hashes generated by ownCloud
Using a higher value requires more time and CPU power to calculate the hashes

::

	'trusted_domains' =>
	  array (
	    'demo.example.org',
	    'otherdomain.example.org',
	  ),

Your list of trusted domains that users can log into. Specifying trusted
domains prevents host header poisoning. Do not remove this, as it performs
necessary security checks.

::

	'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',

Where user files are stored; this defaults to ``data/`` in the ownCloud
directory. The SQLite database is also stored here, when you use SQLite. (SQLite is
available only in ownCloud Community Edition)

::

	'version' => '',

The current version number of your ownCloud installation. This is set up
during installation and update, so you shouldn't need to change it.

::

	'dbtype' => 'sqlite',

Identifies the database used with this installation. See also config option
``supportedDatabases``

Available:
	- sqlite (SQLite3 - Community Edition Only)
	- mysql (MySQL/MariaDB)
	- pgsql (PostgreSQL)
	- oci (Oracle - Enterprise Edition Only)
	- mssql (Microsoft SQL Server - Enterprise Edition Only)

::

	'dbhost' => '',

Your host server name, for example ``localhost``, ``hostname``,
``hostname.example.com``, or the IP address. To specify a port use
``hostname:####``; to specify a Unix socket use
``localhost:/path/to/socket``.

::

	'dbname' => 'owncloud',

The name of the ownCloud database, which is set during installation. You
should not need to change this.

::

	'dbuser' => '',

The user that ownCloud uses to write to the database. This must be unique
across ownCloud instances using the same SQL database. This is set up during
installation, so you shouldn't need to change it.

::

	'dbpassword' => '',

The password for the database user. This is set up during installation, so
you shouldn't need to change it.

::

	'dbtableprefix' => '',

Prefix for the ownCloud tables in the database.

::

	'dbdriveroptions' => array(
		PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => '/file/path/to/ca_cert.pem',
	),

Additional driver options for the database connection, eg. to enable SSL
encryption in MySQL.

::

	'sqlite.journal_mode' => 'DELETE',

sqlite3 journal mode can be specified using this config parameter - can be 'WAL' or 'DELETE'
see for more details https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html

::

	'installed' => false,

Indicates whether the ownCloud instance was installed successfully; ``true``
indicates a successful installation, and ``false`` indicates an unsuccessful
installation.
.. DEFAULT_SECTION_END
.. Generated content above. Don't change this.

Default config.php Examples
---------------------------
When you use SQLite as your ownCloud database, your ``config.php`` looks like
this after installation. The SQLite database is stored in your ownCloud
``data/`` directory. SQLite is a simple, lightweight embedded database that
is good for testing and for simple installations, but for production ownCloud
systems you should use MySQL, MariaDB, or PosgreSQL.

::

  <?php
  $CONFIG = array (
    'instanceid' => 'occ6f7365735',
    'passwordsalt' => '2c5778476346786306303',
    'trusted_domains' =>
    array (
      0 => 'localhost',
      1 => 'studio',
    ),
    'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',
    'dbtype' => 'sqlite3',
    'version' => '7.0.2.1',
    'installed' => true,
  );

This example is from a new ownCloud installation using MariaDB::


  <?php
  $CONFIG = array (
    'instanceid' => 'oc8c0fd71e03',
    'passwordsalt' => '515a13302a6b3950a9d0fdb970191a',
    'trusted_domains' =>
    array (
      0 => 'localhost',
      1 => 'studio',
      2 => '192.168.10.155'
    ),
    'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',
    'dbtype' => 'mysql',
     'version' => '7.0.2.1',
    'dbname' => 'owncloud',
    'dbhost' => 'localhost',
    'dbtableprefix' => 'oc_',
    'dbuser' => 'oc_carla',
    'dbpassword' => '67336bcdf7630dd80b2b81a413d07',
    'installed' => true,
  );

.. ALL_OTHER_SECTIONS_START


User Experience
---------------

These optional parameters control some aspects of the user interface. Default
values, where present, are shown.


::

	'default_language' => 'en',

This sets the default language on your ownCloud server, using ISO_639-1
language codes such as ``en`` for English, ``de`` for German, and ``fr`` for
French. It overrides automatic language detection on public pages like login
or shared items. User's language preferences configured under "personal ->
language" override this setting after they have logged in.

::

	'defaultapp' => 'files',

Set the default app to open on login. Use the app names as they appear in the
URL after clicking them in the Apps menu, such as documents, calendar, and
gallery. You can use a comma-separated list of app names, so if the first
app is not enabled for a user then ownCloud will try the second one, and so
on. If no enabled apps are found it defaults to the Files app.

::

	'knowledgebaseenabled' => true,

``true`` enables the Help menu item in the user menu (top right of the
ownCloud Web interface). ``false`` removes the Help item.

::

	'enable_avatars' => true,

``true`` enables avatars, or user profile photos. These appear on the User
page, on user's Personal pages and are used by some apps (contacts, mail,
etc). ``false`` disables them.

::

	'allow_user_to_change_display_name' => true,

``true`` allows users to change their display names (on their Personal
pages), and ``false`` prevents them from changing their display names.

::

	'remember_login_cookie_lifetime' => 60*60*24*15,

Lifetime of the remember login cookie, which is set when the user clicks the
``remember`` checkbox on the login screen. The default is 15 days, expressed
in seconds.

::

	'session_lifetime' => 60 * 60 * 24,

The lifetime of a session after inactivity; the default is 24 hours,
expressed in seconds.

::

	'session_keepalive' => true,

Enable or disable session keep-alive when a user is logged in to the Web UI.

Enabling this sends a "heartbeat" to the server to keep it from timing out.

::

	'skeletondirectory' => '',

The directory where the skeleton files are located. These files will be
copied to the data directory of new users. Leave empty to not copy any
skeleton files.

::

	'user_backends' => array(
		array(
			'class' => 'OC_User_IMAP',
			'arguments' => array('{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl}INBOX')
		)
	),

The ``user_backends`` app (which needs to be enabled first) allows you to
configure alternate authentication backends. Supported backends are:
IMAP (OC_User_IMAP), SMB (OC_User_SMB), and FTP (OC_User_FTP).

Mail Parameters
---------------

These configure the email settings for ownCloud notifications and password
resets.


::

	'mail_domain' => 'example.com',

The return address that you want to appear on emails sent by the ownCloud
server, for example ``oc-admin@example.com``, substituting your own domain,
of course.

::

	'mail_from_address' => 'owncloud',

FROM address that overrides the built-in ``sharing-noreply`` and
``lostpassword-noreply`` FROM addresses.

::

	'mail_smtpdebug' => false,

Enable SMTP class debugging.

::

	'mail_smtpmode' => 'sendmail',

Which mode to use for sending mail: ``sendmail``, ``smtp``, ``qmail`` or
``php``.

If you are using local or remote SMTP, set this to ``smtp``.

If you are using PHP mail you must have an installed and working email system
on the server. The program used to send email is defined in the ``php.ini``
file.

For the ``sendmail`` option you need an installed and working email system on
the server, with ``/usr/sbin/sendmail`` installed on your Unix system.

For ``qmail`` the binary is /var/qmail/bin/sendmail, and it must be installed
on your Unix system.

::

	'mail_smtphost' => '127.0.0.1',

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Specified the IP address of your mail
server host. This may contain multiple hosts separated by a semi-colon. If
you need to specify the port number append it to the IP address separated by
a colon, like this: ``127.0.0.1:24``.

::

	'mail_smtpport' => 25,

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Specify the port for sending mail.

::

	'mail_smtptimeout' => 10,

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. This set an SMTP server timeout, in
seconds. You may need to increase this if you are running an anti-malware or
spam scanner.

::

	'mail_smtpsecure' => '',

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Specify when you are using ``ssl`` or
``tls``, or leave empty for no encryption.

::

	'mail_smtpauth' => false,

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. Change this to ``true`` if your mail
server requires authentication.

::

	'mail_smtpauthtype' => 'LOGIN',

This depends on ``mail_smtpmode``. If SMTP authentication is required, choose
the authentication type as ``LOGIN`` (default) or ``PLAIN``.

::

	'mail_smtpname' => '',

This depends on ``mail_smtpauth``. Specify the username for authenticating to
the SMTP server.

::

	'mail_smtppassword' => '',

This depends on ``mail_smtpauth``. Specify the password for authenticating to
the SMTP server.

Proxy Configurations
--------------------


::

	'overwritehost' => '',

The automatic hostname detection of ownCloud can fail in certain reverse
proxy and CLI/cron situations. This option allows you to manually override
the automatic detection; for example ``www.example.com``, or specify the port
``www.example.com:8080``.

::

	'overwriteprotocol' => '',

When generating URLs, ownCloud attempts to detect whether the server is
accessed via ``https`` or ``http``. However, if ownCloud is behind a proxy
and the proxy handles the ``https`` calls, ownCloud would not know that
``ssl`` is in use, which would result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Valid values are ``http`` and ``https``.

::

	'overwritewebroot' => '',

ownCloud attempts to detect the webroot for generating URLs automatically.

For example, if ``www.example.com/owncloud`` is the URL pointing to the
ownCloud instance, the webroot is ``/owncloud``. When proxies are in use, it
may be difficult for ownCloud to detect this parameter, resulting in invalid
URLs.

::

	'overwritecondaddr' => '',

This option allows you to define a manual override condition as a regular
expression for the remote IP address. For example, defining a range of IP
addresses starting with ``10.0.0.`` and ending with 1 to 3:
``^10\.0\.0\.[1-3]$``

::

	'overwrite.cli.url' => '',

Use this configuration parameter to specify the base url for any urls which
are generated within ownCloud using any kind of command line tools (cron or
occ). The value should contain the full base URL:
``https://www.example.com/owncloud``

::

	'proxy' => '',

The URL of your proxy server, for example ``proxy.example.com:8081``.

::

	'proxyuserpwd' => '',

The optional authentication for the proxy to use to connect to the internet.

The format is: ``username:password``.

Deleted Items (trash bin)
-------------------------

These parameters control the Deleted files app.


::

	'trashbin_retention_obligation' => 30,

When the trash bin app is enabled (default), this is the number of days a
file will be kept in the trash bin. Default is 30 days.

::

	'trashbin_auto_expire' => true,

Disable or enable auto-expiration for the trash bin. By default
auto-expiration is enabled.

ownCloud Verifications
----------------------

ownCloud performs several verification checks. There are two options,
``true`` and ``false``.


::

	'appcodechecker' => true,

Check 3rd party apps to make sure they are using the private API and not the
public API. If the app uses the private API it cannot be installed.

::

	'updatechecker' => true,

Check if ownCloud is up-to-date and shows a notification if a new version is
available.

::

	'has_internet_connection' => true,

Is ownCloud connected to the Internet or running in a closed network?

::

	'check_for_working_webdav' => true,

Allows ownCloud to verify a working WebDAV connection. This is done by
attempting to make a WebDAV request from PHP.

::

	'check_for_working_htaccess' => true,

This is a crucial security check on Apache servers that should always be set
to ``true``. This verifies that the ``.htaccess`` file is writable and works.

If it is not, then any options controlled by ``.htaccess``, such as large
file uploads, will not work. It also runs checks on the ``data/`` directory,
which verifies that it can't be accessed directly through the web server.

::

	'config_is_read_only' => false,

In certain environments it is desired to have a read-only config file.

When this switch is set to ``true`` ownCloud will not verify whether the
configuration is writable. However, it will not be possible to configure
all options via the web-interface. Furthermore, when updating ownCloud
it is required to make the config file writable again for the update
process.

Logging
-------


::

	'log_type' => 'owncloud',

By default the ownCloud logs are sent to the ``owncloud.log`` file in the
default ownCloud data directory.

If syslogging is desired, set this parameter to ``syslog``.
Setting this parameter to ``errorlog`` will use the PHP error_log function
for logging.

::

	'logfile' => 'owncloud.log',

Change the ownCloud logfile name from ``owncloud.log`` to something else.

::

	'loglevel' => 2,

Loglevel to start logging at. Valid values are: 0 = Debug, 1 = Info, 2 =
Warning, 3 = Error. The default value is Warning.

::

	'logdateformat' => 'F d, Y H:i:s',

This uses PHP.date formatting; see http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

::

	'logtimezone' => 'Europe/Berlin',

The default timezone for logfiles is UTC. You may change this; see
http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

::

	'log_query' => false,

Append all database queries and parameters to the log file. Use this only for
debugging, as your logfile will become huge.

::

	'cron_log' => true,

Log successful cron runs.

::

	'log_rotate_size' => false,

Enables log rotation and limits the total size of logfiles. The default is 0,
or no rotation. Specify a size in bytes, for example 104857600 (100 megabytes
= 100 * 1024 * 1024 bytes). A new logfile is created with a new name when the
old logfile reaches your limit. The total size of all logfiles is double the
``log_rotate_sizerotation`` value.

Alternate Code Locations
------------------------

Some of the ownCloud code may be stored in alternate locations.


::

	'3rdpartyroot' => '',

ownCloud uses some 3rd party PHP components to provide certain functionality.

These components are shipped as part of the software package and reside in
``owncloud/3rdparty``. Use this option to configure a different location.

::

	'3rdpartyurl' => '',

If you have an alternate ``3rdpartyroot``, you must also configure the URL as
seen by a Web browser.

::

	'customclient_desktop' =>
		'http://owncloud.org/sync-clients/',
	'customclient_android' =>
		'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owncloud.android',
	'customclient_ios' =>
		'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/owncloud/id543672169?mt=8',

This section is for configuring the download links for ownCloud clients, as
seen in the first-run wizard and on Personal pages.

Apps
----

Options for the Apps folder, Apps store, and App code checker.


::

	'appstoreenabled' => true,

When enabled, admins may install apps from the ownCloud app store.

The app store is disabled by default for ownCloud Enterprise Edition

::

	'appstoreurl' => 'https://api.owncloud.com/v1',

The URL of the appstore to use.

::

	'apps_paths' => array(
		array(
			'path'=> '/var/www/owncloud/apps',
			'url' => '/apps',
			'writable' => true,
		),
	),

Use the ``apps_paths`` parameter to set the location of the Apps directory,
which should be scanned for available apps, and where user-specific apps
should be installed from the Apps store. The ``path`` defines the absolute
file system path to the app folder. The key ``url`` defines the HTTP web path
to that folder, starting from the ownCloud web root. The key ``writable``
indicates if a web server can write files to that folder.

::

	'appcodechecker' => true,

Check 3rd party apps to make sure they are using the private API and not the
public API. If the app uses the private API it cannot be installed.





Previews
--------

ownCloud supports previews of image files, the covers of MP3 files, and text
files. These options control enabling and disabling previews, and thumbnail
size.


::

	'enable_previews' => true,

By default, ownCloud can generate previews for the following filetypes:

- Images files
- Covers of MP3 files
- Text documents

Valid values are ``true``, to enable previews, or
``false``, to disable previews

::

	'preview_max_x' => null,

The maximum width, in pixels, of a preview. A value of ``null`` means there
is no limit.

::

	'preview_max_y' => null,

The maximum height, in pixels, of a preview. A value of ``null`` means there
is no limit.

::

	'preview_max_scale_factor' => 10,

If a lot of small pictures are stored on the ownCloud instance and the
preview system generates blurry previews, you might want to consider setting
a maximum scale factor. By default, pictures are upscaled to 10 times the
original size. A value of ``1`` or ``null`` disables scaling.

::

	'preview_max_filesize_image' => 50,

max file size for generating image previews with imagegd (default behaviour)
If the image is bigger, it'll try other preview generators,
but will most likely show the default mimetype icon

Value represents the maximum filesize in megabytes
Default is 50
Set to -1 for no limit

::

	'preview_libreoffice_path' => '/usr/bin/libreoffice',

custom path for LibreOffice/OpenOffice binary

::

	'preview_office_cl_parameters' =>
		' --headless --nologo --nofirststartwizard --invisible --norestore '.
		'-convert-to pdf -outdir ',

Use this if LibreOffice/OpenOffice requires additional arguments.

::

	'enabledPreviewProviders' => array(
		'OC\Preview\Image',
		'OC\Preview\MP3',
		'OC\Preview\TXT',
		'OC\Preview\MarkDown'
	),

Only register providers that have been explicitly enabled

The following providers are enabled by default:

 - OC\\Preview\\Image
 - OC\\Preview\\MarkDown
 - OC\\Preview\\MP3
 - OC\\Preview\\TXT

The following providers are disabled by default due to performance or privacy
concerns:

 - OC\\Preview\\Illustrator
 - OC\\Preview\\Movie
 - OC\\Preview\\MSOffice2003

 - OC\\Preview\\Postscript
 - OC\\Preview\\StarOffice
 - OC\\Preview\\SVG
 - OC\\Preview\\TIFF

.. note:: Troubleshooting steps for the MS Word previews are available
   at the :doc:`../configuration_files/collaborative_documents_configuration`
   section of the Administrators Manual.

The following providers are not available in Microsoft Windows:

 - OC\\Preview\\Movie
 - OC\\Preview\\MSOfficeDoc
 - OC\\Preview\\MSOffice2003
 - OC\\Preview\\MSOffice2007
 - OC\\Preview\\OpenDocument
 - OC\\Preview\\StarOffice

LDAP
----

Global settings used by LDAP User and Group Backend


::

	'ldapUserCleanupInterval' => 51,

defines the interval in minutes for the background job that checks user
existance and marks them as ready to be cleaned up. The number is always
minutes. Setting it to 0 disables the feature.

See command line (occ) methods ldap:show-remnants and user:delete

Maintenance
-----------

These options are for halting user activity when you are performing server
maintenance.


::

	'maintenance' => false,

Enable maintenance mode to disable ownCloud

If you want to prevent users to login to ownCloud before you start doing some
maintenance work, you need to set the value of the maintenance parameter to
true. Please keep in mind that users who are already logged-in are kicked out
of ownCloud instantly.

::

	'singleuser' => false,

When set to ``true``, the ownCloud instance will be unavailable for all users
who are not in the ``admin`` group.

SSL
---


::

	'forcessl' => false,

Change this to ``true`` to require HTTPS for all connections, and to reject
HTTP requests.

::

	'forceSSLforSubdomains' => false,

Change this to ``true`` to require HTTPS connections also for all subdomains.

Works only together when `forcessl` is set to true.

::

	'openssl' => array(
		'config' => '/absolute/location/of/openssl.cnf',
	),

Extra SSL options to be used for configuration.

Miscellaneous
-------------


::

	'blacklisted_files' => array('.htaccess'),

Blacklist a specific file or files and disallow the upload of files
with this name. ``.htaccess`` is blocked by default.

WARNING: USE THIS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

::

	'share_folder' => '/',

Define a default folder for shared files and folders other than root.

::

	'theme' => '',

If you are applying a theme to ownCloud, enter the name of the theme here.

The default location for themes is ``owncloud/themes/``.

::

	'xframe_restriction' => true,

X-Frame-Restriction is a header which prevents browsers from showing the site
inside an iframe. This is be used to prevent clickjacking. It is risky to
disable this, so leave it set at ``true``.

::

	'cipher' => 'AES-256-CFB',

The default cipher for encrypting files. Currently AES-128-CFB and
AES-256-CFB are supported.

::

	'redis' => array(
		'host' => 'localhost', // can also be a unix domain socket: '/tmp/redis.sock'
		'port' => 6379,
		'timeout' => 0.0
	),

Connection details for redis to use for memory caching.

Redis is only used if other memory cache options (xcache, apc, apcu) are
not available.

::

	'memcached_servers' => array(
		// hostname, port and optional weight. Also see:
		// http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcached.addservers.php
		// http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcached.addserver.php
		array('localhost', 11211),
		//array('other.host.local', 11211),
	),

Server details for one or more memcached servers to use for memory caching.

Memcache is only used if other memory cache options (xcache, apc, apcu, redis) are
not available.

::

	'cache_path' => '',

Location of the cache folder, defaults to ``data/$user/cache`` where
``$user`` is the current user. When specified, the format will change to
``$cache_path/$user`` where ``$cache_path`` is the configured cache directory
and ``$user`` is the user.

::

	'quota_include_external_storage' => false,

EXPERIMENTAL: option whether to include external storage in quota
calculation, defaults to false.

::

	'filesystem_check_changes' => 1,

Specifies how often the filesystem is checked for changes made outside
ownCloud.

0 -> Never check the filesystem for outside changes, provides a performance
increase when it's certain that no changes are made directly to the
filesystem

1 -> Check each file or folder at most once per request, recommended for
general use if outside changes might happen.

2 -> Check every time the filesystem is used, causes a performance hit when
using external storages, not recommended for regular use.

::

	'asset-pipeline.enabled' => false,

All css and js files will be served by the web server statically in one js
file and one css file if this is set to ``true``.

::

	'assetdirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud',

The parent of the directory where css and js assets will be stored if
piplelining is enabled; this defaults to the ownCloud directory. The assets
will be stored in a subdirectory of this directory named 'assets'. The
server *must* be configured to serve that directory as $WEBROOT/assets.

You will only likely need to change this if the main ownCloud directory
is not writeable by the web server in your configuration.

::

	'mount_file' => 'data/mount.json',

Where ``mount.json`` file should be stored, defaults to ``data/mount.json``

::

	'filesystem_cache_readonly' => false,

When ``true``, prevent ownCloud from changing the cache due to changes in the
filesystem for all storage.

::

	'objectstore' => array(
		'class' => 'OC\\Files\\ObjectStore\\Swift',
		'arguments' => array(
			// trystack will user your facebook id as the user name
			'username' => 'facebook100000123456789',
			// in the trystack dashboard go to user -> settings -> API Password to
			// generate a password
			'password' => 'Secr3tPaSSWoRdt7',
			// must already exist in the objectstore, name can be different
			'container' => 'owncloud',
			// create the container if it does not exist. default is false
			'autocreate' => true,
			// required, dev-/trystack defaults to 'RegionOne'
			'region' => 'RegionOne',
			// The Identity / Keystone endpoint
			'url' => 'http://8.21.28.222:5000/v2.0',
			// required on dev-/trystack
			'tenantName' => 'facebook100000123456789',
			// dev-/trystack uses swift by default, the lib defaults to 'cloudFiles'
			// if omitted
			'serviceName' => 'swift',
		),
	),

The example below shows how to configure ownCloud to store all files in a
swift object storage.

It is important to note that ownCloud in object store mode will expect
exclusive access to the object store container because it only stores the
binary data for each file. The metadata is currently kept in the local
database for performance reasons.

WARNING: The current implementation is incompatible with any app that uses
direct file IO and circumvents our virtual filesystem. That includes
Encryption and Gallery. Gallery will store thumbnails directly in the
filesystem and encryption will cause severe overhead because key files need
to be fetched in addition to any requested file.

One way to test is applying for a trystack account at http://trystack.org/

::

	'supportedDatabases' => array(
