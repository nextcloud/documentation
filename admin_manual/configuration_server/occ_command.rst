=====================
Using the occ command
=====================

Nextcloud's ``occ`` command (origins from "ownCloud Console") is Nextcloud's command-line
interface. You can perform many common server operations with ``occ``, such as
installing and upgrading Nextcloud, manage users, encryption, passwords, LDAP
setting, and more.

``occ`` is in the :file:`nextcloud/` directory; for example
:file:`/var/www/nextcloud` on Ubuntu Linux. ``occ`` is a PHP script. **You must
run it as your HTTP user** to ensure that the correct permissions are maintained
on your Nextcloud files and directories.

.. _http_user_label:

Run occ as your HTTP user
-------------------------

The HTTP user is different on the various Linux distributions:

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is www-data.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is apache.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is http.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is wwwrun, and the HTTP group is www.

If your HTTP server is configured to use a different PHP version than the
default (/usr/bin/php), ``occ`` should be run with the same version. For
example, in CentOS 6.5 with SCL-PHP70 installed, the command looks like this::

  sudo -u apache /opt/rh/php70/root/usr/bin/php /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ

.. note:: Although the following examples make use of the ``sudo -u ... /path/to/php /path/to/occ`` method, your environment may require use of a different wrapper utility than ``sudo`` to execute the command as the appropriate user. Other common wrappers:

  * ``su --command '/path/to/php ...' username`` -- Note here that the target user specification comes at the end, and the command to execute is specified first.
  * ``runuser --user username -- /path/to/php ...`` -- This wrapper might be used in container contexts (ex: Docker / ``arm32v7/nextcloud``) where both ``sudo`` and ``su`` wrapper utilities cannot be used.

Running ``occ`` with no options lists all commands and options, like this
example on Ubuntu::

 sudo -u www-data php occ
 Nextcloud version 19.0.0

 Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

 Options:
  -h, --help            Display this help message
  -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
  -V, --version         Display this application version
      --ansi            Force ANSI output
      --no-ansi         Disable ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
      --no-warnings     Skip global warnings, show command output only
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output,
                        2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

 Available commands:
  check                 check dependencies of the server
                        environment
  help                  Displays help for a command
  list                  Lists commands
  status                show some status information
  upgrade               run upgrade routines after installation of
                        a new release. The release has to be
                        installed before.

This is the same as ``sudo -u www-data php occ list``.

Run it with the ``-h`` option for syntax help::

 sudo -u www-data php occ -h

Display your Nextcloud version::

 sudo -u www-data php occ -V
   Nextcloud version 19.0.0

Query your Nextcloud server status::

 sudo -u www-data php occ status
   - installed: true
   - version: 19.0.0.12
   - versionstring: 19.0.0
   - edition:

``occ`` has options, commands, and arguments. Options and arguments are
optional, while commands are required. The syntax is::

 occ [options] command [arguments]

Get detailed information on individual commands with the ``help`` command, like
this example for the ``maintenance:mode`` command::

 sudo -u www-data php occ help maintenance:mode
 Usage:
  maintenance:mode [options]

 Options:
      --on              enable maintenance mode
      --off             disable maintenance mode
  -h, --help            Display this help message
  -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
  -V, --version         Display this application version
      --ansi            Force ANSI output
      --no-ansi         Disable ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
      --no-warnings     Skip global warnings, show command output only
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output,
                        2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

The ``status`` command from above has an option to define the output format.
The default is plain text, but it can also be ``json``::

 sudo -u www-data php occ status --output=json
 {"installed":true,"version":"19.0.0.9","versionstring":"19.0.0","edition":""}

or ``json_pretty``::

 sudo -u www-data php occ status --output=json_pretty
 {
    "installed": true,
    "version": "19.0.0.12",
    "versionstring": "19.0.0",
    "edition": ""
 }

This output option is available on all list and list-like commands:
``status``, ``check``, ``app:list``, ``config:list``, ``encryption:status``
and ``encryption:list-modules``

Enabling autocompletion
-----------------------

.. note:: Command autocompletion currently only works if the user you use to execute the occ commands has a profile.
  ``www-data`` in most cases is ``nologon`` and therefor **cannot** use this feature.

Autocompletion is available for bash (and bash based consoles).
To enable it, you have to run **one** of the following commands::

 # BASH ~4.x, ZSH
 source <(/var/www/html/nextcloud/occ _completion --generate-hook)

 # BASH ~3.x, ZSH
 /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ _completion --generate-hook | source /dev/stdin

 # BASH (any version)
 eval $(/var/www/html/nextcloud/occ _completion --generate-hook)

This will allow you to use autocompletion with the full path ``/var/www/html/nextcloud/occ <tab>``.

If you also want to use autocompletion on occ from within the directory without using the full path,
you need to specify ``--program occ`` after the ``--generate-hook``.

If you want the completion to apply automatically for all new shell sessions, add the command to your
shell's profile (eg. ``~/.bash_profile`` or ``~/.zshrc``).

.. _apps_commands_label:

Apps commands
-------------

The ``app`` commands list, enable, and disable apps::

 app
  app:install      install selected app
  app:disable      disable an app
  app:enable       enable an app
  app:getpath      get an absolute path to the app directory
  app:list         list all available apps
  app:update       update an app or all apps
  app:remove       disable and remove an app

Download and install an app::

 sudo -u www-data php occ app:install twofactor_totp

Install but don't enable::

 sudo -u www-data php occ app:install --keep-disabled twofactor_totp

List all of your installed apps, and show whether they are
enabled or disabled::

 sudo -u www-data php occ app:list

Enable an app, for example the External Storage Support app::

 sudo -u www-data php occ app:enable files_external
 files_external enabled

Disable an app::

 sudo -u www-data php occ app:disable files_external
 files_external disabled

You can get the full filepath to an app::

    sudo -u www-data php occ app:getpath notifications
    /var/www/nextcloud/apps/notifications

To update an app, for instance Contacts::

    sudo -u www-data php occ app:update contacts

To update all apps::

    sudo -u www-data php occ app:update --all

.. _background_jobs_selector_label:

Background jobs selector
------------------------

Use the ``background`` command to select which scheduler you want to use for
controlling background jobs, Ajax, Webcron, or Cron. This is the same as using
the **Cron** section on your Nextcloud Admin page::

 background
  background:ajax       Use ajax to run background jobs
  background:cron       Use cron to run background jobs
  background:webcron    Use webcron to run background jobs

This example selects Ajax::

 sudo -u www-data php occ background:ajax
   Set mode for background jobs to 'ajax'

The other two commands are:

* ``background:cron``
* ``background:webcron``

See :doc:`background_jobs_configuration` to learn more.

.. _config_commands_label:

Config commands
---------------

The ``config`` commands are used to configure the Nextcloud server::

 config
  config:app:delete      Delete an app config value
  config:app:get         Get an app config value
  config:app:set         Set an app config value
  config:import          Import a list of configs
  config:list            List all configs
  config:system:delete   Delete a system config value
  config:system:get      Get a system config value
  config:system:set      Set a system config value

You can list all configuration values with one command::

 sudo -u www-data php occ config:list

By default, passwords and other sensitive data are omitted from the report, so
the output can be posted publicly (e.g. as part of a bug report). In order to
generate a full backport of all configuration values the ``--private`` flag
needs to be set::

 sudo -u www-data php occ config:list --private

The exported content can also be imported again to allow the fast setup of
similar instances. The import command will only add or update values. Values
that exist in the current configuration, but not in the one that is being
imported are left untouched::

 sudo -u www-data php occ config:import filename.json

It is also possible to import remote files, by piping the input::

 sudo -u www-data php occ config:import < local-backup.json

.. note::

  While it is possible to update/set/delete the versions and installation
  statuses of apps and Nextcloud itself, it is **not** recommended to do this
  directly. Use the ``occ app:enable``, ``occ app:disable`` and ``occ app:update``
  commands instead.

Getting a single configuration value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These commands get the value of a single app or system configuration::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:get version
  19.0.0.12

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:app:get activity installed_version
  2.2.1

Setting a single configuration value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These commands set the value of a single app or system configuration::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set logtimezone
  --value="Europe/Berlin"
  System config value logtimezone set to Europe/Berlin

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:app:set files_sharing
  incoming_server2server_share_enabled --value="yes" --type=boolean
  Config value incoming_server2server_share_enabled for app files_sharing set to yes

The ``config:system:set`` command creates the value, if it does not already
exist. To update an existing value,  set ``--update-only``::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set doesnotexist --value="true"
  --type=boolean --update-only
  Value not updated, as it has not been set before.

Note that in order to write a Boolean, float, or integer value to the
configuration file, you need to specify the type on your command. This
applies only to the ``config:system:set`` command. The following values are
known:

* ``boolean``
* ``integer``
* ``float``
* ``string`` (default)

When you want to e.g. disable the maintenance mode run the following command::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set maintenance --value=false
  --type=boolean
  Nextcloud is in maintenance mode - no app have been loaded
  System config value maintenance set to boolean false

Setting an array configuration value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some configurations (e.g. the trusted domain setting) are an array of data.
In this case, ``config:system:get`` for this key will return multiple values::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:get trusted_domains
  localhost
  nextcloud.local
  sample.tld

To set one of multiple values, you need to specify the array index as the
second ``name`` in the ``config:system:set`` command, separated by a
space. For example, to replace ``sample.tld`` with ``example.com``,
``trusted_domains => 2`` needs to be set::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set trusted_domains 2
  --value=example.com
  System config value trusted_domains => 2 set to string example.com

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:get trusted_domains
  localhost
  nextcloud.local
  example.com

Setting a hierarchical configuration value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some configurations use hierarchical data. For example, the settings
for the Redis cache would look like this in the ``config.php`` file::

  'redis' => array(
    'host' => '/var/run/redis/redis.sock',
    'port' => 0,
    'dbindex' => 0,
    'password' => 'secret',
    'timeout' => 1.5,
  )

Setting such hierarchical values works similarly to setting an array
value above. For this Redis example, use the following commands::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set redis host \
  --value=/var/run/redis/redis.sock
  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set redis port --value=0
  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set redis dbindex --value=0
  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set redis password --value=secret
  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:set redis timeout --value=1.5

Deleting a single configuration value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These commands delete the configuration of an app or system configuration::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:delete maintenance:mode
  System config value maintenance:mode deleted

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:app:delete appname provisioning_api
  Config value provisioning_api of app appname deleted

The delete command will by default not complain if the configuration was not set
before. If you want to be notified in that case, set the
``--error-if-not-exists`` flag::

  sudo -u www-data php occ config:system:delete doesnotexist
  --error-if-not-exists
  Config provisioning_api of app appname could not be deleted because it did not
  exist

.. _dav_label:

Dav commands
------------

A set of commands to create and manage addressbooks and calendars::

 dav
  dav:create-addressbook        Create a dav addressbook
  dav:create-calendar           Create a dav calendar
  dav:list-calendars            List all calendars of a user
  dav:move-calendar             Move a calendar from a user to another
  dav:remove-invalid-shares     Remove invalid dav shares
  dav:send-event-reminders      Sends event reminders
  dav:sync-birthday-calendar    Synchronizes the birthday calendar
  dav:sync-system-addressbook   Synchronizes users to the system
                                addressbook


The syntax for ``dav:create-addressbook`` and  ``dav:create-calendar`` is
``dav:create-addressbook [user] [name]``. This example creates the addressbook
``mollybook`` for the user molly::

 sudo -u www-data php occ dav:create-addressbook molly mollybook

This example creates a new calendar for molly::

 sudo -u www-data php occ dav:create-calendar molly mollycal

Molly will immediately see these in the Calendar and Contacts apps.

``dav:lists-calendars [user]`` will display a table listing the calendars for a given user.
This example will list all calendars for user annie::

 sudo -u www-data php occ dav:list-calendars annie

``dav::move-calendar [name] [sourceuid] [destinationuid]`` allows the admin
to move a calendar named ``name`` from a user ``sourceuid`` to the user
``destinationuid``. You can use the force option `-f` to enforce the move if there
are conflicts with existing shares. The system will also generate a new unique
calendar name in case there is a conflict over the destination user.

This example will move calendar named personal from user dennis to user sabine::

 sudo -u www-data php occ dav:move-calendar personal dennis sabine

``dav:remove-invalid-shares`` will remove invalid shares created by a bug into the calendar app

``dav:send-event-reminders`` is a command that should be called regularly through a dedicated
cron job to send event reminder notifications.

See :doc:`../groupware/calendar` for more information on how to use this command.

``dav:sync-birthday-calendar`` adds all birthdays to your calendar from
addressbooks shared with you. This example syncs to your calendar from user
bernie::

 sudo -u www-data php occ dav:sync-birthday-calendar bernie

``dav:sync-system-addressbook`` synchronizes all users to the system
addressbook::

 sudo -u www-data php occ dav:sync-system-addressbook

.. _database_conversion_label:

Database conversion
-------------------

The SQLite database is good for testing, and for Nextcloud servers with small
single-user workloads that do not use sync clients, but production servers with
multiple users should use MariaDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. You can use ``occ`` to
convert from SQLite to one of these other databases.

::

 db
  db:convert-type           Convert the Nextcloud database to the newly
                            configured one
  db:generate-change-script generates the change script from the current
                            connected db to db_structure.xml

You need:

* Your desired database and its PHP connector installed.
* The login and password of a database admin user.
* The database port number, if it is a non-standard port.

This is example converts SQLite to MySQL/MariaDB::

 sudo -u www-data php occ db:convert-type mysql oc_dbuser 127.0.0.1
 oc_database

For a more detailed explanation see
:doc:`../configuration_database/db_conversion`

.. _database_add_indices_label:

Add missing indices
-------------------

It might happen that we add from time to time new indices to already existing database tables,
for example to improve performance. In order to check your database for missing indices run
following command::

 sudo -u www-data php occ db:add-missing-indices

.. _encryption_label:

Encryption
----------

``occ`` includes a complete set of commands for managing encryption::

 encryption
  encryption:change-key-storage-root   Change key storage root
  encryption:decrypt-all               Disable server-side encryption and
                                       decrypt all files
  encryption:disable                   Disable encryption
  encryption:enable                    Enable encryption
  encryption:enable-master-key         Enable the master key. Only available
                                       for fresh installations with no existing
                                       encrypted data! There is also no way to
                                       disable it again.
  encryption:encrypt-all               Encrypt all files for all users
  encryption:list-modules              List all available encryption modules
  encryption:set-default-module        Set the encryption default module
  encryption:show-key-storage-root     Show current key storage root
  encryption:status                    Lists the current status of encryption

``encryption:status`` shows whether you have active encryption, and your default
encryption module. To enable encryption you must first enable the Encryption
app, and then run ``encryption:enable``::

 sudo -u www-data php occ app:enable encryption
 sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:enable
 sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:status
  - enabled: true
  - defaultModule: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE

``encryption:change-key-storage-root`` is for moving your encryption keys to a
different folder. It takes one argument, ``newRoot``, which defines your new
root folder::

 sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:change-key-storage-root /etc/oc-keys

You can see the current location of your keys folder::

 sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:show-key-storage-root
 Current key storage root:  default storage location (data/)

``encryption:list-modules`` displays your available encryption modules. You will
see a list of modules only if you have enabled the Encryption app. Use
``encryption:set-default-module [module name]`` to set your desired module.

``encryption:encrypt-all`` encrypts all data files for all users. You must first
put your Nextcloud server into :ref:`maintenance
mode<maintenance_commands_label>` to prevent any user activity until encryption
is completed.

``encryption:decrypt-all`` decrypts all user data files, or optionally a single
user::

 sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:decrypt freda

Users must have enabled recovery keys on their Personal pages. You must first
put your Nextcloud server into :ref:`maintenance
mode <maintenance_commands_label>` to prevent any user activity until
decryption is completed.

Note that if you do not have master key/recovery key enabled, you can ONLY
decrypt files per user, one user at a time and NOT when in maintenance mode.
You will need the users' password to decrypt the files.

Use ``encryption:disable`` to disable your encryption module. You must first put
your Nextcloud server into :ref:`maintenance mode <maintenance_commands_label>`
to prevent any user activity.

``encryption:enable-master-key`` creates a new master key, which is used for all
user data instead of individual user keys. This is especially useful to enable
single-sign on. Use this only on fresh installations with no existing data, or
on systems where encryption has not already been enabled. It is not possible to
disable it.

See :doc:`../configuration_files/encryption_configuration` to learn more.

.. _federation_sync_label:

Federation sync
---------------

.. note::
  This command is only available when the "Federation" app (``federation``) is
  enabled.

Synchronize the addressbooks of all federated Nextcloud servers::

 federation:sync-addressbooks  Synchronizes addressbooks of all
                               federated clouds

In Nextcloud, servers connected with federation shares can share user
address books, and auto-complete usernames in share dialogs. Use this command
to synchronize federated servers::

  sudo -u www-data php occ federation:sync-addressbooks

.. _file_operations_label:

File operations
---------------

``occ`` has three commands for managing files in Nextcloud::

 files
  files:cleanup              cleanup filecache
  files:scan                 rescan filesystem
  files:scan-app-data        rescan the AppData folder
  files:transfer-ownership   All files' and folders' ownerships are moved to another
                             user. Outgoing shares are moved as well.
                             Incoming shares are not moved by default because the
                             sharing user holds the ownership of the respective files.
                             There is however an option to enable moving incoming shares.

Scan
^^^^

The ``files:scan`` command scans for new files and updates the file cache. You
may rescan all files, per-user, a space-delimited list of users, and limit the
search path. If not using ``--quiet``, statistics will be shown at the end of
the scan::

 sudo -u www-data php occ files:scan --help
   Usage:
   files:scan [-p|--path="..."] [-q|--quiet] [-v|vv|vvv --verbose] [--all]
   [user_id1] ... [user_idN]

 Arguments:
   user_id               will rescan all files of the given user(s)

 Options:
   --path                limit rescan to the user/path given
   --all                 will rescan all files of all known users
   --quiet               suppress any output
   --verbose             files and directories being processed are shown
                         additionally during scanning
   --unscanned           scan only previously unscanned files

Verbosity levels of ``-vv`` or ``-vvv`` are automatically reset to ``-v``

Note for option --unscanned:
In general there is a background job (through cron) that will do that scan periodically.
The --unscanned option makes it possible to trigger this from the CLI.

When using the ``--path`` option, the path must consist of following
components::

  "user_id/files/path"
    or
  "user_id/files/mount_name"
    or
  "user_id/files/mount_name/path"

where the term ``files`` is mandatory.

Example::

  --path="/alice/files/Music"

In the example above, the user_id ``alice`` is determined implicitly from the
path component given.

The ``--path``, ``--all`` and ``[user_id]`` parameters are exclusive - only
one must be specified.

Scan appdata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Appdata is a folder inside of the data directory which contains files that
are shared between users and can be put there by the server or apps like
avatar images, file previews and cached CSS files for example.

Since the regular files scan only operates on user files the ``occ files:scan-app-data``
command will check the appdata directory and make sure that the filecache is consistent
with the files on the actual storage.::

  Usage:
    files:scan-app-data [options] [--] [<folder>]

  Arguments:
    folder                 The appdata subfolder to scan [default: ""]


Cleanup
^^^^^^^

``files:cleanup`` tidies up the server's file cache by deleting all file
entries that have no matching entries in the storage table.

Transfer
^^^^^^^^

You may transfer all files and shares from one user to another. This is useful
before removing a user::

 sudo -u www-data php occ files:transfer-ownership <source-user> <destination-user>

It is also possible to transfer only one directory along with it's contents. This can be useful to restructure your organization or quotas. The ``--path`` argument is given as the path to the directory as seen from the source user::

 sudo -u www-data php occ files:transfer-ownership --path="path_to_dir" <source-user> <destination-user>

In case the incoming shares must be transferred as well, use the argument ``--transfer-incoming-shares``::

 sudo -u www-data php occ files:transfer-ownership --transfer-incoming-shares=1 --path="path_to_dir" <source-user> <destination-user>

As an alternative, the system configuration option ``transferIncomingShares`` in config.php can be set to ``true`` to always transfer incoming shares.

Users may also transfer files or folders selectively by themselves.
See `user documentation <https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/files/transfer_ownership.html>`_ for details.

.. _occ_sharing_label:

Files Sharing
-------------

Commands for handling shares::

 sharing
  sharing:cleanup-remote-storages  Cleanup shared storage entries that have no matching entry in the shares_external table
  sharing:expiration-notification  Notify share initiators when a share will expire the next day

.. _files_external_label:

Files external
--------------

.. note::
  These commands are only available when the "External storage support" app
  (``files_external``) is enabled.

Commands for managing external storage::

 files_external
  files_external:applicable  Manage applicable users and groups for a mount
  files_external:backends    Show available authentication and storage backends
  files_external:config      Manage backend configuration for a mount
  files_external:create      Create a new mount configuration
  files_external:delete      Delete an external mount
  files_external:export      Export mount configurations
  files_external:import      Import mount configurations
  files_external:list        List configured mounts
  files_external:option      Manage mount options for a mount
  files_external:verify      Verify mount configuration
  files_external:notify      Listen for active update notifications for a configured external mount

These commands replicate the functionality in the Nextcloud Web GUI, plus two new
features:  ``files_external:export`` and ``files_external:import``.

Use ``files_external:export`` to export all admin mounts to stdout, and
``files_external:export [user_id]`` to export the mounts of the specified
Nextcloud user.

Use ``files_external:import [filename]`` to import legacy JSON configurations,
and to copy external mount configurations to another Nextcloud server.

.. _integrity_check_label:

Integrity check
---------------

Apps which have a ``Featured`` tag MUST be code signed with Nextcloud. Unsigned featured apps won't be installable anymore. Code signing is optional for all third-party applications::

 integrity
  integrity:check-app                 Check app integrity using a signature.
  integrity:check-core                Check core integrity using a signature.
  integrity:sign-app                  Signs an app using a private key.
  integrity:sign-core                 Sign core using a private key

After creating your signing key, sign your app like this example::

 sudo -u www-data php occ integrity:sign-app --privateKey=/Users/lukasreschke/contacts.key --certificate=/Users/lukasreschke/CA/contacts.crt --path=/Users/lukasreschke/Programming/contacts

Verify your app::

  sudo -u www-data php occ integrity:check-app --path=/pathto/app appname

When it returns nothing, your app is signed correctly. When it returns a message then there is an error. See `Code Signing
<https://docs.nextcloud.org/server/latest/developer_manual/app/code_signing.html#how-to-get-your-app-signed>`_ in the Developer manual for more detailed information.

.. TODO ON RELEASE: Update version number above on release

``integrity:sign-core`` is for Nextcloud core developers only.

See :doc:`../issues/code_signing` to learn more.

.. _create_javascript_translation_files_label:

l10n, create JavaScript translation files for apps
--------------------------------------------------

This command is for app developers to update their translation mechanism from
ownCloud 7 to Nextcloud.

.. _ldap_commands_label:

LDAP commands
-------------

.. note::
  These commands are only available when the "LDAP user and group backend" app
  (``user_ldap``) is enabled.

These LDAP commands appear only when you have enabled the LDAP app. Then
you can run the following LDAP commands with ``occ``::

 ldap
  ldap:check-user               checks whether a user exists on LDAP.
  ldap:create-empty-config      creates an empty LDAP configuration
  ldap:delete-config            deletes an existing LDAP configuration
  ldap:search                   executes a user or group search
  ldap:set-config               modifies an LDAP configuration
  ldap:show-config              shows the LDAP configuration
  ldap:show-remnants            shows which users are not available on
                                LDAP anymore, but have remnants in
                                Nextcloud.
  ldap:test-config              tests an LDAP configuration

Search for an LDAP user, using this syntax::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:search [--group] [--offset="..."]
 [--limit="..."] search

Searches will match at the beginning of the attribute value only. This example
searches for givenNames that start with "rob"::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:search "rob"

This will find robbie, roberta, and robin. Broaden the search to find, for
example, ``jeroboam`` with the asterisk wildcard::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:search "*rob"

User search attributes are set with ``ldap:set-config``
(below). For example, if your search attributes are
``givenName`` and ``sn`` you can find users by first name + last name very
quickly. For example, you'll find Terri Hanson by searching for ``te ha``.
Trailing whitespaces are ignored.

Check if an LDAP user exists. This works only if the Nextcloud server is
connected to an LDAP server::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:check-user robert

``ldap:check-user`` will not run a check when it finds a disabled LDAP
connection. This prevents users that exist on disabled LDAP connections from
being marked as deleted. If you know for certain that the user you are searching for
is not in one of the disabled connections, and exists on an active connection,
use the ``--force`` option to force it to check all active LDAP connections::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:check-user --force robert

``ldap:create-empty-config`` creates an empty LDAP configuration. The first
one you create has no ``configID``, like this example::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:create-empty-config
   Created new configuration with configID ''

This is a holdover from the early days, when there was no option to create
additional configurations. The second, and all subsequent, configurations
that you create are automatically assigned IDs::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:create-empty-config
    Created new configuration with configID 's01'

Then you can list and view your configurations::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:show-config

And view the configuration for a single configID::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:show-config s01

``ldap:delete-config [configID]`` deletes an existing LDAP configuration::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:delete  s01
 Deleted configuration with configID 's01'

The ``ldap:set-config`` command is for manipulating configurations, like this
example that sets search attributes::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:set-config s01 ldapAttributesForUserSearch
 "cn;givenname;sn;displayname;mail"

``ldap:test-config`` tests whether your configuration is correct and can bind to
the server::

 sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:test-config s01
 The configuration is valid and the connection could be established!

``ldap:show-remnants`` is for cleaning up the LDAP mappings table, and is
documented in :doc:`../configuration_user/user_auth_ldap_cleanup`.

.. _logging_commands_label:

Logging commands
----------------

These commands view and configure your Nextcloud logging preferences::

 log
  log:file        manipulate Nextcloud logging backend
  log:manage      manage logging configuration
  log:tail        tail the nextcloud logfile [requires app "Log Reader" to be enabled]
  log:watch       watch the nextcloud logfile live [requires app "Log Reader" to be enabled]

Run ``log:file [--] [--enable] [--file] [--rotate-size]`` to see your current logging status::

 sudo -u www-data php occ log:file
 Log backend Nextcloud: enabled
 Log file: /opt/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log
 Rotate at: disabled

* ``--enable`` turns on logging.
* ``--file`` sets a different log file path.
* ``--rotate-size`` sets your rotation by log file size in bytes with; 0 disables rotation.

``log:manage [--backend] [--level] [--timezone]`` sets your logging backend, log level, and timezone. The defaults
are ``file``, ``warning``, and ``UTC``. Available options are:

* ``--backend [file, syslog, errorlog, systemd]``
* ``--level [debug|info|warning|error|fatal]``
* ``--timezone`` according to https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

.. _maintenance_commands_label:

Maintenance commands
--------------------

Use these commands when you upgrade Nextcloud, manage encryption, perform
backups and other tasks that require locking users out until you are finished::

 maintenance
  maintenance:data-fingerprint        update the systems data-fingerprint after a backup is restored
  maintenance:mimetype:update-db      Update database mimetypes and update filecache
  maintenance:mimetype:update-js      Update mimetypelist.js
  maintenance:mode                    set maintenance mode
  maintenance:repair                  repair this installation
  maintenance:theme:update            Apply custom theme changes
  maintenance:update:htaccess         Updates the .htaccess file

``maintenance:mode`` locks the sessions of all logged-in users, including
administrators, and displays a status screen warning that the server is in
maintenance mode. Users who are not already logged in cannot log in until
maintenance mode is turned off. When you take the server out of maintenance mode
logged-in users must refresh their Web browsers to continue working::

 sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --on
 sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off

After restoring a backup of your data directory or the database, you should always
call ``maintenance:data-fingerprint`` once. This changes the ETag for all files
in the communication with sync clients, allowing them to realize a file was modified.

The ``maintenance:repair`` command runs automatically during upgrades to clean
up the database, so while you can run it manually there usually isn't a need
to::

 sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:repair

``maintenance:mimetype:update-db`` updates the Nextcloud database and file cache
with changed mimetypes found in ``config/mimetypemapping.json``. Run this
command after modifying ``config/mimetypemapping.json``. If you change a
mimetype, run ``maintenance:mimetype:update-db --repair-filecache`` to apply the
change to existing files.

Run the ``maintenance:theme:update`` command if the icons of your custom theme are not updated correctly. This updates the mimetypelist.js and cleares the image cache.

.. _security_commands_label:

Security
--------

Use these commands to manage server-wide SSL certificates. These are useful when you create federation shares with other Nextcloud servers that use self-signed certificates::

 security
  security:certificates         list trusted certificates
  security:certificates:import  import trusted certificate
  security:certificates:remove  remove trusted certificate

This example lists your installed certificates::

 sudo -u www-data php occ security:certificates

Import a new certificate::

 sudo -u www-data php occ security:import /path/to/certificate

Remove a certificate::

 sudo -u www-data php occ security:remove [certificate name]

.. _trashbin_label:

Trashbin
--------

.. note::
  This command is only available when the "Deleted files" app
  (``files_trashbin``) is enabled.

The ``trashbin:cleanup  [--all-users] [--] [<user_id>...]`` command removes the deleted files of the specified
users in a space-delimited list, or all users if --all-users is specified.

::

 trashbin
  trashbin:cleanup  [--all-users] [--] [<user_id>...]  Remove deleted files

This example removes the deleted files of all users::

  sudo -u www-data php occ trashbin:cleanup --all-users
  Remove all deleted files for all users
  Remove deleted files for users on backend Database
   freda
   molly
   stash
   rosa
   edward

This example removes the deleted files of users molly and freda::

 sudo -u www-data php occ trashbin:cleanup molly freda
 Remove deleted files of   molly
 Remove deleted files of   freda

.. _user_commands_label:

User commands
-------------

The ``user`` commands create and remove users, reset passwords, display a simple
report showing how many users you have, and when a user was last logged in::

 user
  user:add                            adds a user
  user:delete                         deletes the specified user
  user:disable                        disables the specified user
  user:enable                         enables the specified user
  user:lastseen                       shows when the user was logged in last time
  user:list                           shows list of all registered users
  user:report                         shows how many users have access
  user:resetpassword                  Resets the password of the named user
  user:setting                        Read and modify user settings


You can create a new user with their display name, login name, and any group
memberships with the ``user:add`` command. The syntax is::

 user:add [--password-from-env] [--display-name[="..."]] [-g|--group[="..."]]
 uid

The ``display-name`` corresponds to the **Full Name** on the Users page in your
Nextcloud Web UI, and the ``uid`` is their **Username**, which is their
login name. This example adds new user Layla Smith, and adds them to the
**users** and **db-admins** groups. Any groups that do not exist are created::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:add --display-name="Layla Smith"
   --group="users" --group="db-admins" layla
   Enter password:
   Confirm password:
   The user "layla" was created successfully
   Display name set to "Layla Smith"
   User "layla" added to group "users"
   User "layla" added to group "db-admins"

Go to your Users page, and you will see your new user.

``password-from-env`` allows you to set the user's password from an environment
variable. This prevents the password from being exposed to all users via the
process list, and will only be visible in the history of the user (root)
running the command. This also permits creating scripts for adding multiple new
users.

To use ``password-from-env`` you must run as "real" root, rather than ``sudo``,
because ``sudo`` strips environment variables. This example adds new user Fred
Jones::

 export OC_PASS=newpassword
 su -s /bin/sh www-data -c 'php occ user:add --password-from-env
   --display-name="Fred Jones" --group="users" fred'
 The user "fred" was created successfully
 Display name set to "Fred Jones"
 User "fred" added to group "users"

You can reset any user's password, including administrators (see
:doc:`../configuration_user/reset_admin_password`)::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:resetpassword layla
   Enter a new password:
   Confirm the new password:
   Successfully reset password for layla

You may also use ``password-from-env`` to reset passwords::

 export OC_PASS=newpassword
 su -s /bin/sh www-data -c 'php occ user:resetpassword --password-from-env
   layla'
   Successfully reset password for layla

You can delete users::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:delete fred

View a user's most recent login::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:lastseen layla
   layla's last login: 09.01.2020 18:46

Read user settings::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:setting layla
   - core:
     - lang: en
   - login:
     - lastLogin: 1465910968
   - settings:
     - email: layla@example.tld

Filter by app::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:setting layla core
   - core:
     - lang: en

Get a single setting::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:setting layla core lang
 en

Set a setting::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:setting layla settings email "new-layla@example.tld"

Delete a setting::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:setting layla settings email --delete

Generate a simple report that counts all users, including users on external user
authentication servers such as LDAP::

 sudo -u www-data php occ user:report
 +------------------+----+
 | User Report      |    |
 +------------------+----+
 | Database         | 12 |
 | LDAP             | 86 |
 |                  |    |
 | total users      | 98 |
 |                  |    |
 | user directories | 2  |
 +------------------+----+

.. _group_commands_label:

Group commands
--------------

The ``group`` commands create and remove groups, add and remove users in
groups, display a list of all users in a group::

 group
  group:add                           add a group
  group:delete                        remove a group
  group:adduser                       add a user to a group
  group:removeuser                    remove a user from a group
  group:list                          list configured groups


You can create a new group with the ``group:add`` command. The syntax is::

 group:add [gid]

The ``gid`` corresponds to the group name you entering after clicking
"Add group" on the Users page in your Nextcloud Web UI. This example adds new
group "beer"::

 sudo -u www-data php occ group:add beer

Add an existing user to the specified group with the ``group:adduser``
command. The syntax is::

 group:adduser [gid] [uid]

This example adds the user "denis" to the existing group "beer"::

 sudo -u www-data php occ group:adduser beer denis

You can remove user from the group with the ``group:removeuser`` command.
This example removes the existing user "denis" from the existing
group "beer"::

 sudo -u www-data php occ group:removeuser beer denis

Remove a group with the ``group:delete`` command. Removing a group doesn't
remove users in a group. You cannot remove the "admin" group. This example
removes the existing group "beer"::

 sudo -u www-data php occ group:delete beer

List configured groups via the ``group:list`` command. The syntax is::

 group:list [-l|--limit] [-o|--offset] [--output="..."]

``limit`` allows you to specify the number of groups to retrieve.

``offset`` is an offset for retrieving groups.

``output`` specifies the output format (plain, json or json_pretty). Default is
plain.

.. _versions_label:

Versions
--------

.. note::
  This command is only available when the "Versions" app (``files_versions``) is
  enabled.

Use this command to delete file versions for specific users, or for all users
when none are specified::

 versions
  versions:cleanup   Delete versions

This example deletes all versions for all users::

 sudo -u www-data php occ versions:cleanup
 Delete all versions
 Delete versions for users on backend Database
   freda
   molly
   stash
   rosa
   edward

You can delete versions for specific users in a space-delimited list::

 sudo -u www-data php occ versions:cleanup freda molly
 Delete versions of   freda
 Delete versions of   molly

.. _command_line_installation_label:

Command line installation
-------------------------

These commands are available only after you have downloaded and unpacked the
Nextcloud archive, and taken no further installation steps.

You can install Nextcloud entirely from the command line. After downloading the
tarball and copying Nextcloud into the appropriate directories you can use ``occ``
commands in place of running the graphical Installation Wizard.

Then choose your ``occ`` options. This lists your available options::

.. _command_line_upgrade_label:

Command line upgrade
--------------------

These commands are available only after you have downloaded upgraded packages or
tar archives, and before you complete the upgrade.

List all options, like this example on CentOS Linux::

 sudo -u apache php occ upgrade -h
 Usage:
 upgrade [--quiet]

 Options:
 --help (-h)            Display this help message.
 --quiet (-q)           Do not output any message.
 --verbose (-v|vv|vvv)  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output,
   2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug.
 --version (-V)         Display this application version.
 --ansi                 Force ANSI output.
 --no-ansi              Disable ANSI output.
 --no-interaction (-n)  Do not ask any interactive question

When you are performing an update or upgrade on your Nextcloud server (see the
Maintenance section of this manual), it is better to use ``occ`` to perform the
database upgrade step, rather than the Web GUI, in order to avoid timeouts. PHP
scripts invoked from the Web interface are limited to 3600 seconds. In larger
environments this may not be enough, leaving the system in an inconsistent
state. After performing all the preliminary steps (see
:doc:`../maintenance/upgrade`) use this command to upgrade your databases,
like this example on CentOS Linux. Note how it details the steps::

 sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade
 Nextcloud or one of the apps require upgrade - only a limited number of
 commands are available
 Turned on maintenance mode
 Checked database schema update
 Checked database schema update for apps
 Updated database
 Updating <gallery> ...
 Updated <gallery> to 0.6.1
 Updating <activity> ...
 Updated <activity> to 2.1.0
 Update successful
 Turned off maintenance mode

Enabling verbosity displays timestamps::

 sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade -v
 Nextcloud or one of the apps require upgrade - only a limited number of commands are available
 2015-06-23T09:06:15+0000 Turned on maintenance mode
 2015-06-23T09:06:15+0000 Checked database schema update
 2015-06-23T09:06:15+0000 Checked database schema update for apps
 2015-06-23T09:06:15+0000 Updated database
 2015-06-23T09:06:15+0000 Updated <files_sharing> to 0.6.6
 2015-06-23T09:06:15+0000 Update successful
 2015-06-23T09:06:15+0000 Turned off maintenance mode

If there is an error it throws an exception, and the error is detailed in your
Nextcloud logfile, so you can use the log output to figure out what went wrong,
or to use in a bug report::

 Turned on maintenance mode
 Checked database schema update
 Checked database schema update for apps
 Updated database
 Updating <files_sharing> ...
 Exception
 ServerNotAvailableException: LDAP server is not available
 Update failed
 Turned off maintenance mode

.. _two_factor_auth_label:

Two-factor authentication
-------------------------
If a two-factor provider app is enabled, it is enabled for all users by default
(though the provider can decide whether or not the user has to pass the challenge).
In the case of a user losing access to the second factor (e.g. lost phone with
two-factor SMS verification), the admin can try to disable the two-factor
check for that user via the occ command::
