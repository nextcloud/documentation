Providing Android App Logs
==========================

When opening a issue for our Android app, it is very helpful to include log files right away.
Having the logs at hand allows our support to diagnose and resolve issues faster.

Retrieving Logs Within the App
------------------------------

.. note::

    The screenshots below were taken on Android 16 and Nextcloud Files app 3.34.0.
    The appearance of menus and options may vary slightly depending on your Android version or our app version. Updates to this guide will be made as necessary.

    Accessing logs from within the app requires that the user is successfully logged in.
