Search in mailbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 2.1

At the top of the envelope list in any mail layout, there is a search field shortcut for searching email subjects. Starting from ``version 3.7``, this shortcut allows you to search by subject, recipient (to), or sender (from) by default.

You can access our advanced search feature through a modal located at the end of the search shortcut.

Enable mail body search

Mail bodies can now be searched, this feature is opt-in because of potential performance issues.

.. warning:: If you want to also enable it for unified mailboxes you have to do so in Mail settings

By enabling it the main search box will now search in both subjects and mail bodies, and a separate *Body* option
will appear in advanced search.

Account delegation

The app allows account delegation so that one user can send emails from the address of another.

1) The delegation has to be configured on the mail server by an admin
2) Add the other email address as an alias for your own email account
3) When sending an email, select the alias as sender

.. warning:: The sent email might not be visible to the original account if it's stored in your personal *Sent* mailbox.

.. note::  Only mails deleted after enabling trash retention will be processed.

.. figure:: images/mail_trash_retention_settings.png

Compose messages
----------------

1. Click new message on the top left of your screen
2. Start writing your message

Minimize the composer modal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

The composer modal can be minimized while writing a new message, editing an existing draft or editing a message from the outbox. Simply click the minimize button on the top right of the modal or click anywhere outside the modal.

   .. figure:: images/mail-minimize-composer.png

You can resume your minimized message by clicking anywhere on the indicator on the bottom right of your screen.

   .. figure:: images/mail-composer-indicator.png

Press the close button on the modal or the indicator in the bottom right corner to stop editing a message. A draft will be saved automatically into your draft mailbox.

Outbox
------

When a message has been composed and the "Send" button was clicked, the message is added to the outbox which can be found in the bottom left corner of the left sidebar.

You can also set the date and time for the send operation to a point in the future (see :ref:`Scheduled messages <mail-scheduled-messages>`)- the message will be kept in the outbox until your chosen date and time arrives, then it will be sent automatically.

The outbox is only visible when there is a message waiting to be handled by the outbox.

You can re- open the composer for a message in the outbox any time before the "send"- operation is triggered.

.. note::
   When an error occurs during sending, three error messages are possible:

   Could not copy to "Sent" mailbox
      The mail was sent but couldn't be copied to the "Sent" mailbox. This error will be handled by the outbox and the copy operation will be tried again.
   Mail server error
      Sending was unsuccessful with a state than can be retried (ex: the SMTP server couldn't be reached). The outbox will retry sending the message.
   Message could not be sent
      Sending might or might not have failed. The mail server can't tell us the state of the message. Since the Mail app has no way to determine the state of the message (sent or unsent) the message will stay in the outbox and the account user has to decide how to proceed.
