Web interface.

Desktop Sync Client Shares From File Manager, Selective Sync
------------------------------------------------------------

The Desktop Sync Client now allows you to share files directly from your file

Favorites
---------

Users can now assign a favorite icon to files and folders. Look for 
improvements in this feature in future ownCloud editions to make finding and 
managing files even easier.

Improved Federated Cloud Sharing
--------------------------------

Federated Cloud Sharing, introduced in ownCloud 7 as Server-to-Server sharing, 
allows you to mount file shares from remote ownCloud servers, and create a 
"cloud of ownClouds". In ownCloud 8 the process for creating a new 
sharing link is easier and more streamlined.

Improved Search
---------------

The search interface has been streamlined and simplified, with more features
including enhanced result set reporting and additional search parameters.

Web Interface Enhancements
--------------------------

The ownCloud Web interface has been improved to make it easier for all users to 
access, edit, sync and share their files.

Download Broker Improves Performance
------------------------------------

When ownCloud delivers universal file access to end users, files from many 
different document sources are aggregated into a single interface and served to 
end users. In some cases, passing all of the files aggregated in this interface 
through a single server, ownCloud, slows down data access. ownCloud now 
supports direct downloads of files from select storage back-ends, reducing the 
load on the ownCloud server without sacrificing control over the files that are 
stored in the various back end systems.
