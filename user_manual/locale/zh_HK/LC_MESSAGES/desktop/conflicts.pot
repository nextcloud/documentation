"The Nextcloud desktop client uploads local changes and downloads remote "
"changes. When a file has changed on the local side and on the remote between"
" synchronization runs the client will be unable to resolve the situation on "
"its own. It will create a conflict file with the local version, download the"
" remote version and notify the user that a conflict occurred which needs "
"attention."

"桌面客戶端會上傳近端更改並下載遠端更改。當檔案在近端和遠端之間的同步過程中同時發生變更時，客戶端無法自行解決此問題。它會創建一個衝突檔案以保存近端版本，下載遠端版本，並通知用戶發生了需要處理的衝突。"

"contents\" by someone else."

"假設在您的同步資料夾中有一個名為 ``mydata.txt`` 的檔案。它一段時間沒有變更，並且近端和遠端都包含文本 "

"The desktop client notifies you of this situation via system notifications, "

"To resolve this conflict, open both files, compare the differences and copy "
"your local changes from the \"conflicted copy\" file into the base file "

"要解決這個衝突，打開這兩個檔案，比較差異，並在適用的情況下將您的本地更改從 \"conflicted copy\" "

"預設情況下，衝突檔案（名稱中帶有 \"conflicted copy\" "
