msgid "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to protect your Nextcloud account against unauthorized access. It works by requiring two different 'proofs' of your identity. For example, *something you know* (like a password) and *something you have* like a physical key. Typically, the first factor is a password like you already have and the second can be a text message you receive or a code you generate on your phone or another device (*something you have*). Nextcloud supports a variety of 2nd factors and more can be added."
