msgid "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to protect your Nextcloud account against unauthorized access. It works by requiring two different 'proofs' of your identity. For example, *something you know* (like a password) and *something you have* like a physical key. Typically, the first factor is a password like you already have and the second can be a text message you receive or a code you generate on your phone or another device (*something you have*). Nextcloud supports a variety of 2nd factors and more can be added."

msgid "You will see your secret and a QR code which can be scanned by the TOTP app on your phone (or another device). Depending on the app or tool, type in the code or scan the QR and your device will show a login code which changes every 30 seconds."

msgid "You should always generate backup codes for 2FA. If your 2nd factor device gets stolen or is not working, you will be able to use one of these codes to unlock your account. It effectively functions as a backup 2nd factor. To get the backup codes, go to your Personal Settings and look under Second-factor Auth settings. Choose *Generate backup codes*:"

#: ../../user_2fa.rst:49
msgid "You should put these codes in a safe spot, somewhere you can find them. Don't put them together with your 2nd factor like your mobile phone but make sure that if you lose one, you still have the other. Keeping them at home is probably the best thing to do."

To solve this, you should generate device specific passwords for them. See :doc:`session_management` for more information on how to do this."
