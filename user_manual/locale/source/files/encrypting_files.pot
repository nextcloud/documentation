msgid "Nextcloud includes a server side Encryption app, and when it is enabled by your Nextcloud administrator all of your Nextcloud data files are automatically encrypted on the server. Encryption is server-wide, so when it is enabled you cannot choose to keep your files unencrypted. You don't have to do anything special, as it uses your Nextcloud login as the password for your unique private encryption key. Just log out and in and manage and share your files as you normally do, and you can still change your password whenever you want."

msgid "Its main purpose is to encrypt files on remote storage services that are connected to your Nextcloud server. This is an easy and seamless way to protect your files on remote storage. You can share your remote files through Nextcloud in the usual way, however you cannot share your encrypted files directly from the remote service you are using, because the encryption keys are stored on your Nextcloud server, and are never exposed to outside service providers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../files/encrypting_files.rst:22
msgid "If your Nextcloud server is not connected to any remote storage services, then it is better to use some other form of encryption such as file-level or whole disk encryption. Because the keys are kept on your Nextcloud server, it is possible for your Nextcloud administrator to snoop in your files, and if the server is compromised the intruder may get access to your files. (Read `Encryption in Nextcloud <https://nextcloud.com/blog/encryption-in-nextcloud/>`_ to learn more.)"

In this case, you can set your encryption password to your new login password by providing your old and new login password. The Encryption app works only if your login password and your encryption password are identical."
