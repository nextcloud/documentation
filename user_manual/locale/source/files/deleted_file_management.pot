msgstr ""

#: ../../files/deleted_file_management.rst:42
msgid "To ensure that users do not run over their storage quotas, the Deleted Files app allocates a maximum of 50% of their currently available free space to deleted files. If your deleted files exceed this limit, Nextcloud deletes the oldest files (files with the oldest timestamps from when they were deleted) until it meets the memory usage limit again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../files/deleted_file_management.rst:48
msgid "Nextcloud checks the age of deleted files every time new files are added to the deleted files. By default, deleted files stay in the trash bin for 30 days. The Nextcloud server administrator can adjust this value in the ``config.php`` file by setting the ``trashbin_retention_obligation`` value. Files older than the ``trashbin_retention_obligation`` value will be deleted permanently. Additionally, Nextcloud calculates the maximum available space every time a new file is added. If the deleted files exceed the new maximum allowed space Nextcloud will permanently delete those trashed files with the soonest expiration until the space limit is met again."

#: ../../files/deleted_file_management.rst:58
msgid "Your administrator may have configured the trash bin retention period to override the storage space management. See `admin documentation <https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#deleted-items-trash-bin>`_ for more details."
