msgid "Unlike on Windows, virtual files support on macOS is provided by a separate client version. This allows us to maintain the best possible experience for classically-synced files, including sync status integration and context menu actions, for users who want to keep using this sync method. Just like our classic sync client, the macOS virtual files client is released alongside the desktop client for Windows and Linux, and will benefit from regular bug-fix and feature updates that improve the user experience."

msgid "To improve remote change detection, we recommend enabling the ``notify_push`` app on your Nextcloud server. This app will notify the desktop client of changes on the server as soon as they happen, reducing the time it takes for the client to detect changes. This will also eliminate the need for the desktop client to continuously poll the server for changes."
