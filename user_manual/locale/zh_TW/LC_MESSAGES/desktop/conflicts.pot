"The Nextcloud desktop client uploads local changes and downloads remote "
"changes. When a file has changed on the local side and on the remote between"
" synchronization runs the client will be unable to resolve the situation on "
"its own. It will create a conflict file with the local version, download the"
" remote version and notify the user that a conflict occurred which needs "
"attention."

"桌面客戶端會上傳本機變更並下載遠端變更。當檔案在本地端和遠端同步執行之間發生變更時，客戶端無法自行解決問題。它會與本機版本建立衝突檔案，下載遠端版本，並通知使用者發生衝突需要注意。"

"Imagine there is a file called ``mydata.txt`` your synchronized folder. It "
"has not changed for a while and contains the text \"contents\" locally and "
"remotely. Now, nearly at the same time you update it locally to say \"local "
"contents\" while the file on the server gets updated to contain \"remote "
"contents\" by someone else."
msgstr ""
"想像您的同步資料夾中有一個名為 ``mydata.txt`` "
"的檔案。它已經有一段時間沒有變更了，並包含本機和遠端「內容」文字。現在，幾乎在同一時間，您在本機更新為「本機內容」，而伺服器上的檔案卻被其他人更新為包含「遠端內容」。"

"When attempting to upload your local changes the desktop client will notice "
"that the server version has also changed. It creates a conflict and you will"
" now have two files on your local machine:"

"enables conflict uploading, see below)."
msgstr ""
"在這種情況下，``mydata.txt`` "
"檔案會有遠端變更（並會在遠端變更發生時持續更新），但您的本機調整並未傳送到伺服器（除非伺服器啟用衝突上傳，請參閱下文）。"

"The desktop client notifies you of this situation via system notifications, "
"the system tray icon and a yellow \"unresolved conflicts\" badge in the "
"account settings window. Clicking this badge shows a list that includes the "
"unresolved conflicts and clicking one of them opens an explorer window "
"pointing at the relevant file."
msgstr ""
"桌面客戶端會透過系統通知、系統匣圖示與帳號設定視窗中的黃色「未解決衝突」徽章通知您這種情況。按一下此徽章會顯示包含未解決衝突的清單，按一下其中一個會開啟一個檔案總管視窗，指向相關檔案。"

#: ../../desktop/conflicts.rst:39
msgid ""
"To resolve this conflict, open both files, compare the differences and copy "
"your local changes from the \"conflicted copy\" file into the base file "
"where applicable. In this example you might change ``mydata.txt`` to say "
"\"local and remote contents\" and delete the file with \"conflicted copy\" "
"in its name. With that, the conflict is resolved."
msgstr ""
"要解決此衝突時，請開啟兩個檔案，比較兩者的差異，並在適用的情況下，將您在「衝突副本」檔案中的本機變更複製到基本檔案中。在這個範例中，您可以將 "
"``mydata.txt`` 改為「本機與遠端內容」，並刪除名稱中包含「衝突副本」的檔案。這樣，衝突就解決了。"

"By default the conflict file (the file with \"conflicted copy\" in its name "

" The idea is that you, the author of the changes, are the best person for "
"resolving the conflict and showing the conflict to other users might create "
"confusion."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，衝突檔案（名稱中含有「衝突副本」的檔案，包含您本機的衝突變更）不會上傳到伺服器。這樣做的目的是，您作為變更的作者，是解決衝突的最佳人選，向其他使用者顯示衝突可能會造成混亂。"

#: ../../desktop/conflicts.rst:53
msgid ""
"However, in some scenarios it makes a lot of sense to upload these "
"conflicting changes such that local work can become visible even if the "
"conflict won't be resolved immediately."
msgstr "不過，在某些情況下，上傳這些衝突的變更是很有意義的，這樣即使衝突不會立即解決，本機工作也能變得可見。"

"In the future there might be a server-wide switch for this behavior. For now"
" it can already be tested by setting the environment variable "

msgstr ""
"將來可能會有一個伺服器範圍的開關來處理這個行為。目前已可透過設定環境變數 ``OWNCLOUD_UPLOAD_CONFLICT_FILES=1`` "
"來測試。"
