In Files you can add, remove, and share files, and make changes based on the access privileges
set by you (if you are administering the server) or by your server administrator.

The Nextcloud user interface contains the following fields and functions:

* **Apps Selection Menu** (1): Located in the upper left corner, you'll find all
  your apps which are available on your instance of Nextcloud. Clicking on an
  apps icon will redirect you to the app.

* **Apps Information** field (2): Located in the left sidebar, this provides
  filters and tasks associated with your selected app. For example, when you
  are using the Files apps you have a special set of filters for quickly
  finding your files, such as files that have been shared with you, and files
  that you have shared with others. You'll see different items for other apps.

* **Application View** (3): The main central field in the Nextcloud user interface.
  This field displays the contents or user features of your selected app.
