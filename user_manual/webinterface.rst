.. note:: Some apps like ``files_external`` or ``encryption`` will disable 
   the **Stay logged in** checkbox.

Navigating the Main User Interface
----------------------------------

By default, the Nextcloud Web interface opens to your Files page. You can add, 
remove, and share files, and make changes based on the access privileges set by 
you (if you are administering the server) or by your server administrator.

The Nextcloud user interface contains the following fields and functions:

* **Apps Selection Menu**: Located in the upper left corner, click the arrow to 
  open a dropdown menu to navigate to your various available apps.
  
* **Apps Information** field: Located in the left sidebar, this provides 
  filters and tasks associated with your selected app.  For example, when you 
  are using the Files apps you have a special set of filters for quickly 
  finding your files, such as files that have been shared with you, and files 
  that you have shared with others. You'll see different items for other apps.

* **Application View**: The main central field in the Nextcloud user interface.
  This field displays the contents or user features of your selected app.

* **Navigation Bar**: Located over the main viewing window (the Application
  View), this bar provides a type of breadcrumbs navigation that enables you to
  migrate to higher levels of the folder hierarchy up to the root level (home).

* **New** button: Located in the Navigation Bar, the ``New`` button
  enables you to create new files, new folders, or upload files.

.. note:: You can also drag and drop files from your file manager into the 
   Nextcloud Files Application View to upload them to Nextcloud. Currently, 
   the only Web browsers that support drag-and-drop folders are Chrome and 
   Chromium.

* **Search** field: Click on the magnifier in the upper right hand corner of 
  to search for files.
  
* **Gallery** button. This looks like four little squares, and takes you 
  directly to your image gallery.   

* **Personal Settings** menu: Click on your Nextcloud username, located to the 
  right of the Search field, to open your Personal Settings dropdown menu. Your 
  Personal page provides the following settings and features:

  * Links to download desktop and mobile apps
  * Re-run the First Run Wizard
  * Server usage and space availability

  * Name, email, and profile picture settings
  * Manage connected browsers and devices
