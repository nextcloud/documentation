Encrypting Your Nextcloud Files
==============================

Nextcloud includes an Encryption app, and when it is enabled by your Nextcloud 
administrator all of your Nextcloud data files are automatically encrypted. 
Encryption is server-wide, so when it is enabled you cannot choose to keep your 
files unencrypted. You don't have to do anything special, as it uses your 
Nextcloud login as the password for your unique private encryption key. Just log 
in and out and manage and share your files as you normally do, and you can 
still change your password whenever you want.

Its main purpose is to encrypt files on remote storage services that are 
connected to your Nextcloud server, such as Dropbox and Google Drive. This is an 
easy and seamless way to protect your files on remote storage. You can share 
your remote files through Nextcloud in the usual way, however you cannot share 
your encrypted files directly from Dropbox, Google Drive, or whatever remote 
service you are using, because the encryption keys are stored on your Nextcloud 
server, and are never exposed to outside service providers. 

If your Nextcloud server is not connected to any remote storage services, then 
it is better to use some other form of encryption such as file-level or whole 
disk encryption. Because the keys are kept on your Nextcloud server, it is 
possible for your Nextcloud admin to snoop in your files, and if the server is 
compromised the intruder may get access to your files. (Read

Using Encryption
----------------

Nextcloud encryption is pretty much set it and forget it, but you have a few 
options you can use. 

When your Nextcloud admin enables encryption for the first time, you must log 
out and then log back in to create your encryption keys and encrypt your files. 
When encryption has been enabled on your Nextcloud server you will see a yellow 
banner on your Files page warning you to log out and then log back in.

When you log back in it takes a few minutes to work, depending on how many 
files you have, and then you are returned to your default Nextcloud page.

.. note:: You must never lose your Nextcloud password, because you will lose 
   access to your files. Though there is an optional recovery option that your 
   Nextcloud administrator may enable; see the Recovery Key Password section 
   (below) to learn about this.
   
Sharing Encrypted Files
-----------------------

Only users who have private encryption keys have access to shared encrypted 
files and folders. Users who have not yet created their private encryption keys 
will not have access to encrypted shared files; they will see folders and 
filenames, but will not be able to open or download the files. They will see a 
yellow warning banner that says "Encryption App is enabled but your keys are not 
initialized, please log-out and log-in again."

Share owners may need to re-share files after encryption is enabled; users 
trying to access the share will see a message advising them to ask the share 
owner to re-share the file with them. For individual shares, un-share and 
re-share the file. For group shares, share with any individuals who can't access 
the share. This updates the encryption, and then the share owner can remove the 
individual shares.

Recovery Key Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your Nextcloud administrator has enabled the recovery key feature, you can 
choose to use this feature for your account. If you enable "Password recovery" 
the administrator can read your data with a special password. This feature 
enables the administrator to recover your files in the event you lose your 
Nextcloud password. If the recovery key is not enabled, then there is no way to 
restore your files if you lose your login password.

Files Not Encrypted
-------------------

Only the data in your files is encrypted, and not the filenames or folder 
structures. These files are never encrypted:

- Old files in the trash bin.
- Image thumbnails from the Gallery app.
- Previews from the Files app.
- The search index from the full text search app.
- Third-party app data

There may be other files that are not encrypted; only files that are exposed to 
third-party storage providers are guaranteed to be encrypted.

Change Private Key Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option is only available if your log-in password, but not your encryption
password, was changed by your administrator. This can occur if your Nextcloud
provider uses a external user back-end (for example, LDAP) and changed your
login password using that back-end configuration. In this case, you can set
your encryption password to your new login password by providing your old and
new login password. The Encryption app works only if your login password and
your encryption password are identical.
