==================

Users can transfer the ownership of files and folders to other users. Share 
ownerships of those transfered files/folders will also be transferred.

#. Navigate to *Settings* > *Personal* > *Sharing* > *Files*.
#. Click on *Choose file or folder to transfer* >> A file picker opens, showing all files and folders in the user's account.
#. Pick a file or folder and click on *Choose* >> The chosen file or folder name gets displayed.
#. Click on *Change* to change the choice if necessary.
#. Pick a new owner by typing their name into the search field next to *New owner*.
#. Click on *Transfer*.

	.. note:: The username autocompletion or listing may be limited due to administrative visibility configuration.
	   See `administrator documentation <https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/file_sharing_configuration.html>`_ for details.

#. The target user receives a notification where they are being asked whether to
   accept or reject the incoming transfer.
