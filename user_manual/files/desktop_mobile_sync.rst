==================================
Desktop and Mobile Synchronization
==================================

For synchronizing files with your desktop computer, we recommend using the
`ownCloud Sync Client`_ for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux until the Nextcloud
Sync Client will be released..


The ownCloud Desktop Sync Client enables you to connect to your private 
ownCloud Server.
You can create folders in your home directory, and keep the contents of those
folders synced with your ownCloud server. Simply copy a file into the directory
and the ownCloud desktop client does the rest. Make a change to the files on one
computer, it will flow across the others using these desktop sync clients. 
You will always
have your latest files with you wherever you are.

Its usage is documented separately in the `ownCloud Desktop Client Manual`_.
