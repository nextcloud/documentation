===========================
Making Anonymous Uploads
===========================

If your Nextcloud administrator has enabled the Files Drop application, you may
create your own special upload directories so that other people can upload files
to you without having to log in to the server, and without being an ownCloud user.
They will not be allowed to see the contents of this directory, or to make any 
changes. This is an excellent alternative to sending large attachments via email,
using an FTP server, or using commercial file-sharing services.

Setting Up Your Own File Drop
-----------------------------

Go to Files and create or choose the folder, the anonymous upload should be
made to.

Check Share Link, Allow editing, Hide file listing.
 
.. image:: ../images/anonym_hide_file_listing.png

Now you can send the link to the uploadfolder manualy or by using the
Nextcloud send funktion, if your administrator has enabled it.


Uploading Files
---------------

Using the anonymous upload funktion ist  simple. You receive a link to the upload 
folder, click the link, and then you'll see an Nextcloud page with a **Click to 
upload** button.

This opens a file picker, and you select the file or directory you want to 
upload. You're alos able to yust drop files intoi the window-
   
When your upload is completed, the filenames are listet:
