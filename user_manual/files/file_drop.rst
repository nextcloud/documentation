Making Anonymous Uploads (Enterprise Only)
==========================================

If your ownCloud administrator (Enterprise edition only) has enabled the 
Files Drop application, you may create your own special upload directory so that 
other people can upload files to you without having to log in to the server, and 
without being an ownCloud user. They will not be allowed to see the contents of 
this directory, or to make any changes. This is an excellent alternative to 
sending large attachments via email, using an FTP server, or using commercial 
file-sharing services.

Setting Up Your Own File Drop
-----------------------------

Go to your Personal page and you will see the Files Drop configuration section.

Click the **Choose** button to open a dialog to select your upload directory. 
You may wish to first create a special upload directory (on your Files page), 
which in the following example is name **upload**.

On your Personal page you should now see a URL for your upload directory. Share 
this URL with anyone you want to allow uploads to your Files Drop folder. Note 
that the default maximum upload size in this example is 512MB; this is 
configurable, so contact your ownCloud administrator if you need a larger 
limit.

Uploading Files
---------------

Using the Files Drop app is simple. You receive a link to the upload 
folder, click the link, and then you'll see an ownCloud page with a **Click to 
upload** button.

   :scale: 50%

This opens a file picker, and you select the file or directory you want to 
upload.

When your upload is completed, you'll see a confirmation message with the 
filenames.
