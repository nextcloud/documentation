Thunderbird - Synchronize Addressbook
=====================================

Addressbook
-----------

As someone who is new to Nextcloud, new to CardBook... here is what you need in excruciating pithy detail to make this work (for all the other lost souls out there):

#. `Thunderbird <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/>`_ for your OS unless it comes with your OS distribution (Linux)
#. `CardBook <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/cardbook/>`_ (a Thunderbird contacts add-on.)

With an installed Thunderbird mailtool, an installed CardBook add-on:

1. Cardbook is found in the upper right corner of Thunderbird.

2. In the Thunderbird Cardbook add-on:

   -  "Adressbook > New Adressbook **Remote** > Next
   -  Fill in your information

3. In the bottom left of the Contacts View (in Nextcloud contatcs) look for a little impeller symbol that looks like this:

.. image:: ../images/contacts_link.png

which will display the URL you need for your installation to work: https://cloud.nextcloud.com/remote.php/dav/addressbooks/users/daniel/Thunderbird/

4. Validate your settings and click Next, then choose the name of the addressbook and click Next again.

5. Once installed, synchronize your addressbook by clicking "Synchronize" in the top left corner of CardBook.
You'll see your address book populate from Nextcloud!

The rest of the details of dealing with Thunderbird addressbook are left to the reader... 

Calendar
-----------

#. `Thunderbird <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/>`_ for your OS unless it comes with your OS distribution (Linux)
#. `Lightning <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/lightning/>`_ (a Thunderbird calendar add-on.)
