======================
Using the Contacts App
======================

The Contacts app is not enabled by default in Nextcloud |version| and needs to
be enabled separately. 

You can use the Contacts app to collect and maintain all your contacts. It is possible to create several address books. You can add contacts via the browser interface or you can import existing contacts (vCard). It is possible too to share contacts.
