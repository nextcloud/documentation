======================
Using the Contacts app
======================

The Contacts app is not enabled by default in Nextcloud |version| and needs to
be installed separately from our App Store.

The Nextcloud Contacts app is similar to other mobile contact applications, but
with more functionality. 
Let's run through basic features that will help you maintain your address book
in the application. 

Below, you will learn how to add contacts, edit or remove contacts, upload a 
contact picture and manage your Contact app address books. 


Adding Contacts
---------------

When you first access the Contacts app, an empty default address book becomes available.

  *Default Address Book (empty)*

To add contacts into your address book, you can use one of the following methods:

* Import contacts using a Virtual Contact File (VCF/Vcard) file 
* Add contacts manually

The fastest way to add a contact is to use a Virtual Contact File
(VCF/Vcard) file.


Importing Virtual Contacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To Import Contacts Using a VCF/Vcard File:

1. Find "Settings" at the bottom of the left sidebar, next to the gear button.

      *Contact settings gear button*
  
2. Click the gear button. The Contacts app "Import" button will appear.

    *Contacts Upload Field*
  
.. note:: The Contacts app only supports import of vCards version 3.0 and 4.0.

3. Click the "Import" button and upload your VCF/Vcard file. 

After the import is complete, you will see your new contact in your address book. 


Adding Contacts Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can't import virtual contacts, the Contacts app enables you to **add contacts** manually.

To Create a New Contact:

1. Click the ``+ New contact`` button.

   An empty new contact configuration opens in the Application View field.

2. Specify the new contact information. Changes that you made are implemented immediately.


Edit or Remove Contact Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Contacts app enables you to edit or remove contact information.

To edit or remove contact information:

1. Navigate to the specific contact that you want to modify.
2. Select the information in the field that you want to edit or remove.
3. Make your modifications or click on the trash bin.

Changes or removals that you made to any contact information are implemented immediately.


Contact Picture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a picture for your new contacts, click on the upload button:

Adding and Managing Address Books
---------------------------------

Clicking on the "Settings" (gear) button at the bottom of the left sidebar
provides access to Contact app settings. This field shows all
available address books, certain options for each address book, and enables you
to create new address books, simply by specifying an address books name.

    *Add address book in the contacts settings*

The Contacts settings is also where you can share, export and delete address
books. You will find the CardDAV URLs there.

See :doc:`index` for more details about syncing your address books
with iOS, macOS, Thunderbird and other CardDAV clients.
