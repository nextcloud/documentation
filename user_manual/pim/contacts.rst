======================
Using the Contacts App
======================

The Contacts app is not enabled by default in Nextcloud |version| and needs to
be enabled separately. It is also not a supported core app. It is currently 
under heavy development, so documentation has moved to the `documentation Wiki 
on Github 
<https://github.com/nextcloud/documentation/wiki/Using-the-Contacts-App-in-
Nextcloud-9.0>`_.
