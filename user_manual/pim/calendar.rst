======================
Using the Calendar App
======================

The Calendar app is not enabled by default in ownCloud |version| and needs to
be enabled separately. It is also not a supported core app. It is currently 
under heavy development, so documentation has moved to the `documentation Wiki 
on Github 
<https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/wiki/Using-the-Calendar-App-in- 
ownCloud-9.0>`_. You are welcome to add content to the Wiki document; all you 
need is a Github account.
