During a call, you can mute your microphone and disable your video with the buttons on your video on the bottom-right, or using the shortcuts ``M`` to mute audio and ``V`` to disable video. You can also use the space bar to toggle mute. When you are muted, pressing space will unmute you so you can speak until you let go of the space bar. If you are unmuted, pressing space will mute you until you let go.

You can hide your video (useful during a screen share) with the little arrow just above the video stream. Bring it back with the little arrow again.

Starting a screen share
-----------------------

You can click the monitor icon on your video stream to share your screen. Depending on your browser, you will get the option to share a monitor, an application window or a single browser tab.

More settings
-------------

In the conversation menu you can choose to go full-screen. You can also do this by using the ``F`` key on your keyboard. In the conversation settings, you can find notification options and the full conversation description.
