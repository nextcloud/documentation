Silent messages
---------------

If you don't want to disturb anyone in the middle of the night, there is a silent mode for chatting.
While it is enabled, other participants will not receive notifications from your messages.

Messages expiration
-------------------

.. FIXME Duplicate with conversation management but worth it?

A moderator can configure message expiration under the ``Conversation settings`` within the ``Moderation`` section. Once a message reaches its expiration time, it is automatically removed from the conversation.
The available expiration durations are 1 hour, 8 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks, or never (which is the default setting).
