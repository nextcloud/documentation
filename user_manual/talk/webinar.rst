Webinar
======================

Nextcloud Talk has a number of advanced features users might find useful.

Lobby
-----

The lobby feature allows you to show guests a waiting screen until the call starts. This is ideal for webinars with external participants, for example.

You can choose to let the participants join the call at a specific time, or when you dismiss the lobby manually.
