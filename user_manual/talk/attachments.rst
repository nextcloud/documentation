Sharing files in a chat
-----------------------

You can share files in a chat in 3 ways.

First, you can simply drag'n'drop them on the chat.

Second, you can select a file from your Nextcloud Files or a file manager by choosing the little paperclip and selecting where you'd like to pick the file from.

You can add more files until you are done and decide to share the files. You can also add a text caption to your shared files, providing a brief description or context.

All users will be able to click the files to view, edit or download them, irrespective of them having a user account. Users with an account will have the file automatically shared with them while external guest users will get them shared as a public link.
