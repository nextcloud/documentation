Matterbridge
============

.. FIXME extend with links to win42 and talk_matterbridge, or some basic setup, or remove?

Matterbridge integration in Nextcloud Talk makes it possible to create 'bridges' between Talk conversations and conversations on other chat services like MS Teams, Discord, Matrix and others. You can find a list of supported protocols `on the Matterbridge github page. <https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge#features>`_

A moderator can add a Matterbridge connection in the chat conversation settings.

Each of the bridges has its own need in terms of configuration. Information for most is available on the Matterbridge wiki and can be accessed behind ``more information`` menu in the ``...`` menu. You can also `access the wiki directly. <https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki>`_

Lobby
-----

The lobby feature allows you to show guests a waiting screen until the call starts. This is ideal for webinars with external participants, for example.

You can choose to let the participants join the call at a specific time, or when you dismiss the lobby manually.
