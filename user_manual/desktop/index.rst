You can share one or more files and folders on your computer, and synchronize
them with your Nextcloud server. Place files in your local shared directories,
and those files are immediately synchronized to the server and to other devices
using the Nextcloud Desktop Sync Client, Android app, or iOS app. To
learn more about the Nextcloud desktop client, please refer to:
