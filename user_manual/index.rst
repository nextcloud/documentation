**Welcome to ownCloud: your self-hosted file sync and share solution.**

ownCloud is open source file sync and share software for everyone from
individuals operating the free ownCloud Community Edition, to large enterprises
and service providers operating the ownCloud Enterprise Edition. ownCloud
provides a safe, secure, and compliant file synchronization and sharing
solution on servers that you control.

With ownCloud you can share one or more files and folders on your computer, and
synchronize them with your ownCloud server. Place files in your local shared
directories, and those files are immediately synchronized to the server and to
other devices using the ownCloud Desktop Client. Not near a device running a
desktop client? No problem! Simply log in using the ownCloud web client and
manage your files from there. The ownCloud Android and iOS mobile applications
enable you to browse, download, and upload photos and videos. On Android, you
can also create, download, edit, and upload any other files, as long as the
correct software is installed.

Whether you are using a mobile device, a workstation, or a web client, ownCloud
provides the ability to put the right files in the right hands at the right
time on any device with one simple-to-use, secure, private and controlled
solution. After all, with ownCloud, it’s Your Cloud, Your Data, Your Way.
