**Welcome to Nextcloud: A safe home for all your data.**

Nextcloud is open source file sync and share software for everyone from
individuals operating the free Nextcloud Server in the privacy of their own 
home, to large enterprises and service providers supported by the Nextcloud
Enterprise Subscription. Nextcloud provides a safe, secure, and compliant 
file synchronization and sharing solution on servers that you control.

You can share one or more files and folders on your computer, and synchronize 
them with your Nextcloud server. Place files in your local shared directories, 
and those files are immediately synchronized to the server and to other devices 
using the ownCloud / Nextcloud Desktop Sync Client, Android app, or iOS app. To
learn more about the Nextcloud desktop and mobile clients, please refer to
