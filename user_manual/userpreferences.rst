Setting your preferences
========================

As a user, you can manage your personal settings.

To access your personal settings:

1. Click on your profile picture in the top, right corner of your Nextcloud instance.

   The Personal Settings Menu opens:

2. Choose *Settings* from the drop down menu:

.. note:: If you are an administrator, you can also manage users and administer
   the server. These links do not appear to a non-administrator user.

The options listed in the Personal Settings Page depend on the applications that
are enabled by the administrator. Some of the features you will see
include the following:

* Usage and available quota
* Manage your profile picture
* Full name (You can make this anything you want, as it is separate from your
  Nextcloud login name, which is unique and cannot be changed)
* Email address
* List of your Group memberships
* Change your password
* :doc:`user_2fa`
* :doc:`userpreferences`
* Choose the language for your Nextcloud interface
* Links to desktop and mobile apps
* Manage your Activity stream and notifications
* Default folder to save new documents to
* Your Federated sharing ID
* Social sharing links
* Nextcloud version

.. note:: Available options and settings depending on your administrator's configuration.
   If you are not able to change the password or the display name in your personal settings,
   please contact your administrator for help.
