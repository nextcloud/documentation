.. note:: If you are an administrator, you can also manage users and administer 
   the server by using the related links in the Personal Settings Menu. 
   However, these links do not appear to a normal user.

The options listed in the Personal Settings Page depend on the applications that 
are enabled by the administrator.  However, some of the default settings for 
this page include the following:

* Usage and available quota -- Appearing at the top of the page, this 
  information provides the amount of space used and available for the user (in 
  Megabytes).

* Password -- Enables you to change your password.  To change your password, you 
  must provide your current password along with your new password.  When 
  creating a new password, ownCloud provides a dynamic password strength 
  indicator for your assistance.

  .. note:: If you would like the ability to recover your password through 
     e-mail, specify your email address in the Email field (see below).

* Full Name -- Enables you to specify your full name.  This name appears at the 
  top of the Personal Settings Menu.

* Email -- Enables you to specify an email address for use by the ownCloud 
  server and administrator in sending you notifications.  For information about 
  setting email notifications, see "Notifications" below.

 * Profile picture -- Enables you to specify a new avatar (profile image) that 
   identifies you on the ownCloud server.  By default, the profile picture is 
   the first initial of your username.  You can choose to keep the letter 
   designation, upload a new image from an external source, or select an image 
   from any existing images in your ownCloud folders.

  override the browser settings.

* Notifications -- Enables you to specify what notifications you receive for 
  activities on your ownCloud instance.  You can choose to receive messages 
  through an email notification or online stream notification.  In addition, 
  the Notifications settings enable you to exclude changes that you make 
  yourself and obtain only changes made by others on your account.  You can 
  obtain notifications hourly, daily, or weekly.

  documents are saved.
