	Adding a bookmark manually

In this example, we have added the page `http://wikipedia.org` with the title "Wikipedia"
and some tags describing what Wikipedia is for an easier search later on.

Edit/Delete a bookmark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You also have the possibility to edit or delete a bookmark.

To edit a bookmark, hover over the bookmark and click on the pencil icon. 
The bookmark details will then be filled into the 3 fields at the top of the screen.
Modify your bookmark to your needs then click the save button to persist the change.

To delete a bookmark, hover over the bookmark and click the cross icon.

If you click on a tag, Nextcloud will only display the bookmarks that
are described with this tag.

You can also use the search bar of Nextcloud in the top right of your screen.

Simply click on the "Bookmarks" menu in the sidebar to come back to
the default view.

The creator of this app understands that people won't want to
open the Nextcloud boorkmarks page to add a bookmark every time they see a cool site.
This is why they have made this cool "bookmarklet".

A bookmarklet is small button that you can drag and drop in your bookmarks.
The next time you see a cool new site, click on this special bookmark
to add the site to your Nextcloud bookmarks.

To find this bookmark, click on the gear button at the bottom of the bookmarks app.
